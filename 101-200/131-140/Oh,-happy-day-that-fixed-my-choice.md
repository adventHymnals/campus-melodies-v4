    1. Oh, happy day that fixed my choice
    On thee, my Saviour and my God!
    Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
    And tell its raptures all abroad.


    2. ’Tis done, the great transaction’s done;
    I am my Lord’s, and he is mine;
    He drew me, and I followed on,
    Charmed to confess the voice divine.


    3. Now rest, my long-divided heart,
    Fixed on this blissful center, rest,
    Nor ever from thy Lord depart,
    With him of every good possessed.


    4. High Heaven, that heard the solemn vow,
    That vow renewed shall daily hear,
    Till in time’s latest hour I bow,
    And bless at last a bond so dear.
