    1. To-day the Saviour calls!
    Ye wanderers, come!
    O ye benighted souls,
    Why longer roam?


    2. To-day the Saviour calls!
    Oh! listen now;
    Within these sacred walls,
    To Jesus bow.


    3. To-day the Saviour calls!
    For mercy flee;
    For all the guilty soon
    Must guilty be.


    4. To-day the Saviour calls!
    For refuge fly;
    The storm of vengeance falls;
    Ruin is nigh.
