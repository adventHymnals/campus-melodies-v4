[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Muzfc9%2DwrmTGHTwidjObKXeFlj9c8ME8/edit?mode=html)



    1. By faith I see the day
    That ends my woes,
    When I shall vict’ry gain
    O’er all my foes.


    2. In yonder realms of light,
    By faith I see
    A crown of glory bright,
    Prepared for me.


    3. Oh! may I soon behold
    That happy day,
    When sorrow, sin, and pain,
    Shall flee away!


    4. Oh! may I ever keep
    The prize in view;
    And through the storms of life
    My way pursue.


    5. Jesus, be thou my guide;
    My steps attend;
    Oh! keep me near thy side;
    Be thou my friend.


    6. Be thou my shield and sun,
    Be thou my guard;
    And, when my work is done,
    My great reward.
