    1. ’Tis faith that purifies the heart;
    ’Tis faith that works by love;
    That bids all sinful joys depart,
    And lifts the thoughts above.


    2. Faith shows the promise fully sealed
    With our Redeemer’s blood;
    It helps our feeble hope to rest
    Upon a faithful God.


    3. This faith shall every fear control,
    By its celestial power,—
    With holy triumph fill the soul
    In strong temptation’s hour.
