    1. With joy we meditate the grace
    Of our High Priest above;
    His heart is made of tenderness,
    His bosom glows with love.


    2. Touched with a sympathy within,
    He knows our feeble frame;
    He knows what sore temptations mean,
    For he hath felt the same.


    3. He, in the days of feeble flesh,
    Poured out his cries and tears;
    And in his measure feels afresh
    What every member bears.


    4. Then let our humble faith address
    His mercy and his power;
    We shall obtain delivering grace
    In the distressing hour.
