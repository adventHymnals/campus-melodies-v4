[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N05BmTOajpPaaWK_A0Dl1fjE3XuFVxr_/edit?mode=html)



    1. Oh! fo r a faith that w'ill not shrink,
    Though pressed by many a foe;
    That will not tremble on the brink 
    Of poverty or woe;


    2. That will not murmur or complain
    Beneath the chastening rod;
    But in the hour of grief or pain,
    Can lean upon its God.


    3. A faith that shines more bright and clear
    When tempests rage without;
    That when in danger knows no fear,
    In darkness feels no doubt;


    4. That bears unmoved the world’s dread frown,
    Nor heeds its scornful smile,
    That sin’ s wild ocean cannot drown,
    Nor its soft arts beguile.


    5. Lord, give me such a faith as this,
    And then, what’er may come,
    I’ll taste e’en here the hallowed bliss 
    Of an eternal home.
