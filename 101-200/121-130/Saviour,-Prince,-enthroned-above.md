[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q73wlrZGL7kOTn983sg6x02xpzqkGOS9/edit?mode=html)



    1. Saviour, Prince, enthroned above,
    Repentance to impart,
    Give me, through thy dying love,
    The humble, contrite heart;
    Give what I have long implored,
    A portion of thy grief unknown:
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.


    2. For thine own compassion’s sake,
    The gracious wonder show;
    Cast my sins behind thy back,
    And wash me white as snow:
    If thy pity now is stirred,
    If now I do myself bemoan,
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.


    3. See me, Saviour, from above,
    Nor suffer me to die!
    Life, and happiness, and love,
    Drop from thy gracious eye:
    Speak the reconciling word,
    And let thy mercy melt me down:
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.


    4. Clothe me with thy holiness,
    Thy meek humility:
    Put on me thy glorious dress—
    Endue my soul with thee:
    Let thine image be restored,
    Thy name and nature let me prove:
    Fill me with thy fullness, Lord,
    And perfect me in love.
