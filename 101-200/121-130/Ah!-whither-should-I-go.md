## 126.  'Ah! whither should I go,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PrhcuoR3pscts8NF7XK0aqc__XjxqWKa/edit?mode=html)



    1. Ah! whither should I go,
    Burdened, and sick, and faint?
    To whom should I my trouble show,
    And pour out my complaint?


    2. My Saviour bids me come;
    Ah! why do I delay?
    He calls the weary sinner home,
    And yet from him I stay.


    3. What is it keeps me back,
    From which I cannot part,â€”
    Which will not let the Saviour take
    Possession of my heart?


    4. I now believe, in thee
    Compassion reigns alone; 
    According to my faith, to me 
    Oh, let it, Lord, be done!
