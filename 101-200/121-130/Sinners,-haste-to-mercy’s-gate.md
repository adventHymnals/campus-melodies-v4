[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QLpgtlaynhUB0QgfE5gmPm0ooS4cvp%2DO/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sinners, haste to mercy’s gate,
    Strive, oh! strive to enter there;
    Hasten, lest ye come too late,
    Lest in vain shall be your prayer.


    2. Soon the Saviour will arise,
    And forever shut the door:
    Hopeless then will be your cries;
    God will welcome you no more.


    3. From his glorious seat within,
    Zion’s King so long forgot,
    Then will say, Ye slaves of sin,
    Hence depart, I know you not.


    4. Oh! the anguish of that word;
    Anguish which no measure knows;
    Sinners, haste to seek the Lord,
    Ere the door of mercy close.
