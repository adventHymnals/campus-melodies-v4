[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QIQA3ZRV2ebK%2DpJQRqoQ1fILC2CRderN/edit?mode=html)



    1. Father, I dare believe
    Thee merciful and true!
    Thou wilt my guilty soul forgive,
    My fallen soul renew.


    2. Come, then, for Jesus’ sake,
    And bid my heart be clean;
    An end of all my troubles make,
    An end of all my sin.


    3. While at thy cross I lie,
    Jesus, the grace bestow;
    Now thy all-cleansing blood apply,
    And I am white as snow.


    4. I cannot wash my heart,
    But by believing thee,
    And waiting for thy blood t’impart
    The spotless purity.
