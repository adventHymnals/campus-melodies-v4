[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QUCU%2DBX8W8FqrufRLEjcni%2D1LViwu3KM/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sinner, art thou still secure?
    Wilt thou still refuse to pray?
    Can thy heart or hands endure 
    In the Lordâ€™s avenging day?


    2. At his presence nature shakes;
    Earth affrighted hastes to flee;
    Solid mountains melt like wax;
    What will then become of thee?


    3. Who his advent may abide?
    You that glory in your shame,
    Will you find a place to hide,
    When the world is wrapt in flame?
