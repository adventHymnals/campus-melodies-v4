[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QI2V26ycQw6kUOBnLXBC6QwF6jz%2Degkk/edit?mode=html)



    1. Now is th’ accepted time,
    Now is the day of grace;
    Now, sinners, come without delay, 
    And seek the Saviour’s face.


    2. Now is th’ accepted time,
    The Saviour calls to-day; 
    To-morrow it may be too late
    Then why should you delay?


    3. Now is th’ accepted time,
    The gospel bids you come;
    And every promise in his word 
    Declares there yet is room.
