[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PDilylHcG_W0wiGJvtoH4%2DNLRZ26NWxr/edit?mode=html)



    1. A parting hymn we sing,
    Around thy table, Lord,
    Again our grateful tribute bring,
    Our solemn vows record.


    2. Here have we seen thy face,
    And felt thy presence here;
    So may the savor of thy grace
    In word and life appear.


    3. The purchase of thy blood—
    By sin no longer led—
    The path our dear Redeemer trod
    May we rejoicing tread.


    4. In self-forgetting love
    Be our communion shown,
    Until we join the church above,
    And know as we are known.
