    1. There is a dear and hallowed spot
    Oft present to my eye;
    By saints it ne’er can be forgot—
    That place is Calvary.


    2. Oh! what a scene was there displayed,
    Of love and agony,
    When our Redeemer bowed his head,
    And died on Calvary.


    3. When fainting under guilt’s dread load,
    Unto the cross I ’ll fly,
    And trust the merits of that blood
    That flowed at Calvary.


    4. Whene’er I feel temptation’s power,
    On Jesus I ’ll rely,
    And in the sharp, conflicting hour
    Repair to Calvary.
