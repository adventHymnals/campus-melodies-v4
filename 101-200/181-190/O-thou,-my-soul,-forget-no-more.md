[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PMV2WTwA4HjLEkIkSXzn1prvl27iBDcp/edit?mode=html)



    1. O thou, my soul, forget no more
    The Friend who all thy sorrows bore;
    Let every idol be forgot;
    But, O my soul, forget Him not.


    2. Eternal truth and mercy shine
    In him, and he himself is thine;
    And canst thou, then, with sin beset,
    Such charms, such matchless charms, forget?


    3. Oh, no! till life itself depart,
    His name shall cheer and warm my heart-
    And, lisping this, from earth Iâ€™ll rise,
    And join the chorus of the skies.
