[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHulT6SW%2DhCaOorBWSJwr2_a27HpLkhT/edit?mode=html)



    1. Saviour of our ruined race,
    Fountain of redeeming grace,
    Let us now thy fullness see,
    While we here converse with thee;
    Hearken to our ardent prayer—
    Let us all thy blessings share.


    2. While we thus with glad accord
    Meet around thy table, Lord,
    Bid us feast with joy divine,
    On th’ appointed bread and wine:
    Emblems may they truly prove
    Of our Saviour’s bleeding love.


    3. Weak, unworthy, sinful, vile,
    Yet we seek the heavenly smile;
    Thou canst all our sins forgive;
    Thou canst bid us look and live.
    Lord, we wonder and adore!
    Oh, for grace to love thee more!
