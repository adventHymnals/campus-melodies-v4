[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PallGyfGk4c1uefxb1Er8sT9qdtkLFWJ/edit?mode=html)



    1. With Jesus in our midst,
    We gather round the board;
    Though many, we are one in Christ,
    One body in the Lord.


    2. Our sins were laid on him
    When bruised on Calvary;
    For us he died, and rose again,
    A pledge of victory.


    3. Faith eats the bread of life,
    And drinks the living wine;
    Thus we, in love together knit,
    On Jesusâ€™ breast recline.


    4. Then let our powers unite,
    His glorious name to raise;
    And holy joy fill every mind,
    And every voice be praise.
