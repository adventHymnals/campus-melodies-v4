## 188.  'Rock of ages, cleft for me,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PpIXfcSl5W4j42VO9tSHLIM2P9z49HGN/edit?mode=html)



    1. Rock of ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in thee;
    Let the water and the blood,
    From thy wounded side that flowed,
    Be of sin the perfect cure:
    Save me, Lord, and make me pure.


    2. Should my tears forever flow,
    Should my zeal no languor know,
    This, for sin, could not atone:
    Thou must save, and thou alone.
    In my hand no price I bring;
    Simply to thy cross I cling.


    3. When my pilgrimage I close,
    Victor oâ€™er the last of foes,
    When I soar to worlds unknown,
    See thee on thy Judgment throne,
    Rock of ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in thee.
