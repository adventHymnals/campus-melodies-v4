    1. From the table now retiring,
    Which for us the Lord hath spread,
    May our souls refreshment finding,
    Grow in all things like our Head.


    2. His example while beholding,
    May our lives his image bear;
    Him our Lord and Master calling,
    His commands may we revere.


    3. Love to God and man displaying,
    Walking steadfast in his way,
    Joy attend us in believing,
    Peace from God, through endless day.
