[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OgmNhgPa1JMKj4D1PaZckkLde9Epr6WA/edit?mode=html)



    1. Welcome, the Sabbath hour,
    The holy and the blest!
    With sweet, subduing power,
    It calms the soul to rest;
    And hope and love spring up anew,
    To cheer us on our journey through.


    2. Our only care and aim
    Throughout this hallowed day,
    To glorify thy name,
    And grateful homage pay;
    Advance the glory of thy cause,
    And vindicate thy righteous laws.


    3. Descend, celestial Dove!
    Eâ€™en while we wait and sing;
    Come from the throne of love,
    With healing on thy wing;
    With ardent zeal each heart inspire,
    The saints baptize with holy fire.
