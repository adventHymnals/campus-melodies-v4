[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P8DAOQNpe0X%2DFa3xyIGdu95DZ6NQaYIy/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awaked from sinâ€™s delusive sleep,
    My heavy guilt I feel, and weep;
    Beneath a weight of woes oppressed,
    I come to thee, my Lord, for rest.


    2. Now, from thy throne of grace above,
    Look down upon my soul in love;
    That smile shall sweeten all my pain,
    And make my soul rejoice again.


    3. By thy divine, transforming power,
    My ruined nature now restore;
    And let my life and temper shine,
    In blest resemblance, Lord, to thine.
