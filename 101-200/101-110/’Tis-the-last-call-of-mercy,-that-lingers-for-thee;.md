    1. ’Tis the last call of mercy, that lingers for thee;
    O sinner, receive it; to Jesus now flee!
    He often has called thee; but thou hast refused!
    His offered salvation and love are abused!


    2. If thou slightest this warning now offered at last,
    Thine will be the sad mourning—the harvest is passed;
    Salvation I’ve slighted, the summer is o’er,
    And now there is pardon, sweet pardon, no more.


    3. ’Tis the last call of mercy; Oh! turn not away,
    For now swiftly hasteth the dread vengeance day!
    The Spirit invites you, and pleads with you, come;
    Oh! come to life’s waters, nor thirstingly roam.


    4. ’Tis the last call of mercy; Oh! steel not thy heart,
    For now she is rising, from earth to depart!
    The Bride is now calling—ye thirsty souls, come!
    Oh! come with the ransomed; in Heaven there’s room!


    5. ’Tis the last call of mercy, that lingers for thee;
    Break away from thy bondage, O sinner, be free!
    Be not a sad mourner—the harvest is passed,
    The summer is ended—and perish at last.
