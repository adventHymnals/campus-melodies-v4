    1. Hail peaceful day! divinely blest!
    Sweetly thy glories would we sing— 
    Memorial of that sacred rest 
    Of vast creation’s mighty King.
    This hallowed time to man was given,
    A foretaste of the bliss of Heaven.


    2. Ye saints awake, with joyful lay,
    Behold its rising light, divine;
    To God your grateful homage pay,
    Its radiant beams around us shine. 
    Welcome the day he calls his own,
    And fervent worship at his throne.


    3. Hark! through the shining courts above,
    What rapturous praises echo now! 
    Around that holy law of love,
    Seraphs in adoration bow;
    Let earth, responsive to the strain,
    Exalt alone Jehovah’s name.


    4. O come, thou bright, immortal day!
    When at his temple all adore 
    His scepter’ s universal sway—
    Observed in glory evermore;
    When Zion shall in triumph reign,
    And Eden bloom on earth again.
