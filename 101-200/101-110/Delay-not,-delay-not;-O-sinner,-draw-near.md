## 105.  'Delay not, delay not; O sinner, draw near:'

    1. Delay not, delay not; O sinner, draw near:
    The waters of life are now flowing for thee;
    No price is demanded, the Saviour is here,
    Redemption is purchased, salvation is free.


    2. Delay not, delay not, O sinner, to come,
    For mercy still lingers and calls thee to-day;
    Her voice is not heard in the vale of the tomb,—
    Her message, unheeded, will soon pass away.


    3. Delay not, delay not; the Spirit of grace,
    Long grieved and resisted, may take its sad flight;
    And leave thee in darkness to finish thy race,—
    To sink in the gloom of eternity’s night.
