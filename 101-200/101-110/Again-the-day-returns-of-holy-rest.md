[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ooqm8LypMysnNt7fLsKy9U8QIJkYriT8/edit?mode=html)



    1. Again the day returns of holy rest,
    Which, when he made the world, Jehovah blest; 
    When, like his own, he bade our labors cease,
    And all be piety, and all be peace.


    2. Let us devote this consecrated day
    To learn his will, and all we learn obey;
    So shall he hear, when fervently we raise 
    Our supplications and our songs of praise.


    3. Lord of all worlds! incline thy bounteous ear;
    Thy childrenâ€™s voice in tender mercy hear;
    Bear thy blest promise, fixed as hills, in mind,
    And shed renewing grace on lost mankind.


    4. Father in Heaven! in whom our hopes confide,
    Whose powerdefends us, and whose precepts guide;
    Through life our surest guardian and friend,
    Glory supreme be thine till time shall end.
