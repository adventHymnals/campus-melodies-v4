[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qjv2dNY8DfKQI%2DJ1ob0uSVMmZJ5fygG%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, gracious Spirit, heavenly Dove,
    With light and comfort from above;
    Be thou our guardian, thou our guide;
    O’er all our thoughts and steps preside.


    2. To us the light of truth display,
    And make us know and choose thy way;
    Plant holy fear in every heart,
    That we from God may ne’er depart.


    3. Lead us to holiness— the road
    Which we must take to dwell with God;
    Lead us to Christ— the living way,
    Nor let us from his pastures stray;


    4. Lead us to God— our final rest,—
    To be with him forever blest;
    Lead us to Heaven, its bliss to share—
    Fulness of joy forever there.
