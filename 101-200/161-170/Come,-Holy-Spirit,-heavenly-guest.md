    1. Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly guest,
    And make thy mansion in my breast;
    Dispel my doubts, my fears control,
    And heal the anguish of my soul.


    2. ~~Thou God of love and peace divine,
    Oh, make thy light within me shine!
    Forgive my sins, my guilt remove,
    And send the tokens of thy love..~~^Holy Spirit God of love? Where in the scriptures?^
