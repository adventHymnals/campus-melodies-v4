[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2PZROeMNrWcT4L3HvTOFdotg0Dh0wHB/edit?mode=html)



    1. Holy Spirit, light divine,
    Shine upon this heart of mine;
    Chase the shades of night away,
    Turn the darkness into day.


    2. Holy Spirit, power divine,
    Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
    Long has sin, without control,
    Held dominion oâ€™er my soul.


    3. Holy Spirit, joy divine,
    Cheer this saddened heart of mine;
    Bid my many woes depart;
    Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.


    4. Holy Spirit, all divine,
    Dwell within this heart of mine;
    Cast down every idol throne;
    Reign supreme, and reign alone.
