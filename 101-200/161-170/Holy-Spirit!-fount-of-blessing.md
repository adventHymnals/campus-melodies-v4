[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R5pV2rbT_5hwgaMlUWeGpsRUuYPtbW9c/edit?mode=html)



    1. Holy Spirit! fount of blessing,
    Ever watchful, ever kind;
    Thy celestial aid possessing,
    Prisoned souls deliv’rance find;
    Seal of truth and bond of union,
    Source of light, and flame of love,
    Symbol of divine communion,
    In the olive-bearing dove.


    2. Heavenly guide from paths of error,
    Comforter of minds distressed;
    When the billows fill with terror,
    Pointing to an ark of rest;—
    Promised pledge! eternal Spirit!
    Greater than all gifts below,—
    May our hearts thy grace inherit;
    May our lips thy glories show.
