[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NMgic8kFtzTMUzBVAOYWEUEb44OkjIGb/edit?mode=html)



    1. In every trying hour
    My soul to Jesus flies;
    I trust in his almighty power,
    When swelling billows rise.


    2. His comforts bear me up;
    I trust a faithful God;
    The sure foundation of my hope
    Is in my Saviour’s blood.


    3. Loud hallelujahs sing
    To our Redeemer’s name;
    In joy or sorrow, life or death,
    His love is still the same.
