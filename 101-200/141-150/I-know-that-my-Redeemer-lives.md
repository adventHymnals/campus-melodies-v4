[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NlAeXBdtlwKT4QC5pKEjoD4b1NYx_84h/edit?mode=html)



    1. I know that my Redeemer lives,
    And ever prays for me;
    A token of his love he gives,
    A pledge of liberty.


    2. Jesus, I hang upon thy word;
    I steadfastly believe 
    Thou wilt return, and claim me, Lord, 
    And to thyself receive.


    3. Joyful in hope, my spirit soars
    To meet thee from above;
    Thy goodness thankfully adores,
    And sure I taste thy love.


    4. When God is mine, and I am his,
    Of Paradise possessed,
    I taste unutterable bliss,
    And everlasting rest.
