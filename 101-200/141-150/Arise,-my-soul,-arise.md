## 149.  'Arise, my soul, arise,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiTzQV6VotYwOm9qNvV6PIeiooOutrxJ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Arise, my soul, arise,
    Shake off thy guilty fears;
    The bleeding Sacrifice
    In my behalf appears;
    Before the throne my Saviour stands;
    My name is written on his hands.


    2. He ever lives above,
    For me to intercede;
    His all-redeeming love,
    His precious blood to plead;
    His blood was shed for all our race,
    And sprinkles now the throne of grace.


    3. Five bleeding wounds he bears,
    Received on Calvary;
    They pour effectual prayers,
    They strongly speak for me:
    Forgive him, oh! forgive, they cry,
    Nor let the contrite sinner die!


    4. The Father hears him pray,
    His dear, anointed One;
    He cannot turn away
    The presence of his Son;
    His Spirit answers to the blood,
    And tells me I’m a child of God.


    5. To God I’m reconciled;
    His pardoning voice I hear;
    He owns me for his child;
    I can no longer fear;
    With confidence I now draw nigh,
    And Father, Abba Father, cry.
