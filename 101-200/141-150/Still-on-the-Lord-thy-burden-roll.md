[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NjYSBxn9bMX6Itg5TJjEcpIBPGbvrM%2D6/edit?mode=html)



    1. Still on the Lord thy burden roll,
    Nor let a care remain;
    His mighty arm shall bear thy soul,
    And all thy griefs sustain. 


    2. Neâ€™er will the Lord his aid deny
    To those who trust his love;
    And they who on his grace rely,
    Shall sing his praise above.
