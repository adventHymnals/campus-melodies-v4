[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nmk4Wyd_C3CA4yukHWx7gmD3LZt%2Dor7g/edit?mode=html)



    1. While in this sacred rite of thine,
    Ourselves we offer now,
    Shine o’er the waters, Dove divine, 
    And seal the cheerful vow.


    2. All glory be to Him whose life
    For ours was freely given,
    Who aids us in the spirit’s strife,
    And makes us meet for Heaven.


    3. To thee we gladly now resign
    Our life and all our powers;
    Accept us in this rite divine,
    And bless these hallowed hours.


    4. Oh, may we die to earth and sin,
    Beneath the mystic flood!
    And when we rise may we begin
    To live anew for God.
