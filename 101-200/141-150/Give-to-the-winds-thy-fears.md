## 143.  'Give to the winds thy fears,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NmbSpdadUUm0NDrHlBzdB_gKP9T5N_Ff/edit?mode=html)



    1. Give to the winds thy fears,
    Hope and be undismayed;
    God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears,
    He shall lift up thy head.


    2. Through waves, and clouds, and storms,
    He gently clears thy way;
    Wait thou his time, so shall this night
    Soon end in joyous day.


    3. Thou on the Lord rely,
    So safe shalt thou go on;
    Fix on his work thy steadfast eye,
    So shall thy work be done.


    4. No profit canst thou gain,
    By self-consuming care;
    To him commend thy cause, his ear
    Attends the softest prayer.


    5. Still heavy is thy heart?
    Still sink thy spirits down?
    Cast off the weight, let fear depart,
    And every care be gone.
