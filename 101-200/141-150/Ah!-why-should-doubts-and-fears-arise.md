[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NgxKqeovaa4OXxeJOoTJShGtTHM6E1Tj/edit?mode=html)



    1. Ah! why should doubts and fears arise?
    And sorrows fill my weeping eyes?
    Too slow, alas! the mind receives
    The comforts that the gospel gives.


    2. Oh, for a strong, a lasting faith,
    To credit what th’ Almighty saith!
    T’ embrace the message of his Son,
    And call the joys of Heaven my own.


    3. Then, should the earth’s old pillars shake,
    And all the wheels of nature break,
    My steadfast soul would fear no more
    Than solid rocks when billows roar.
