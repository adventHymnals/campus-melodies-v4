    1. How dreadful was the curse that fell
    On sinful man; ’twas death and hell;
    Eternal death, destruction sure:
    Who, who, such portion could endure?


    2. But glory be to God on high!
    Redemption comes, Good news, they cry—
    The holy throng— th’ Anointed One
    Descends to earth, God’s holy Son,


    3. And dies for man, then lives again
    A victor: he the foe hath slain;
    Abolished death— oh, wondrous plan!
    Salvation brought to fallen man.


    4. Oh! may we be the truly wise,
    Who seek with all our hearts this prize;
    Contend no more for earth’s renown,
    But look for an immortal crown.
