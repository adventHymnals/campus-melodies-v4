[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NC2fJgHS%2DgACYF1ZE38BGnMbzN8jZAIf/edit?mode=html)



    1. Love divine, all love excelling,
    Joy of Heaven, to earth come down!
    Fix in us thy humble dwelling;
    All thy faithful mercies crown,


    2. Jesus! thou art all compassion,â€”
    Pure, unbounded love thou art;
    Visit us with thy salvation,
    Enter every trembling heart.


    3. Breathe, oh! breathe thy loving Spirit
    Into every troubled breast!
    Let us all in thee inherit;
    Let us find thy promised rest.


    4. Changed from glory into glory,
    Till in Heaven we take our place;
    Till we cast our crowns before thee,
    Lost in wonder, love, and praise.
