[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NHxadtrtmeww0NSGuzKLE79Y9GhOZKlo/edit?mode=html)



    1. He dies! the Friend of sinners dies!
    Lo! Salem’s daughters weep around;
    A solemn darkness veils the skies,
    A sudden trembling shakes the ground.


    2. Come, saints, and shed your tears anew,
    For him who groaned beneath your load;
    He shed his precious blood for you,
    Then freely be your tears bestowed.


    3. Here’s love and grief beyond degree,
    The Lord of glory dies for men!
    But lo! what sudden joys we see,
    Jesus the dead revives again!


    4. He lives forever, wondrous King,
    Born to redeem, and strong to save;
    Then ask, O death, where is thy sting?
    And where’s thy victory, boasting grave?
