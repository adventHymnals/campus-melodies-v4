[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nrf5CHoPKmsgF7oXLDV4JbOn1MueymXW/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
    Which before the cross we spend;
    Life, and health, and peace possessing,
    From the sinner’s dying Friend.


    2. Truly blessed is this station,
    Low before his cross to lie,
    While we see divine compassion,
    Beaming in his gracious eye.


    3. Here we feel our sins forgiven,
    While upon the Lamb we gaze;
    And our thoughts are all of Heaven,
    And our lips o’erflow with praise.


    4. Still in ceaseless contemplation,
    Fix our hearts and eyes on thee,
    Till we taste thy full salvation,
    And, unveiled, thy glories see.
