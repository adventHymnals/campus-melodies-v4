[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGlupua8X1MkEh737GOTtWeEqZFbd9gU/edit?mode=html)



    1. Spirit Divine, attend our prayer,
    And make our hearts thy home;
    Descend with all thy gracious power:
    Come, Holy Spirit, come!


    2. Come as the light: to us reveal
    Our sinfulness and woe;
    And lead us in those paths of life
    Where all the righteous go.


    3. Come as the fire, and purge our hearts,
    Like sacrificial flame;
    Let our whole soul an offering be
    To our Redeemerâ€™s name.


    4. Come as the wind, with rushing sound,
    With Pentecostal grace;
    And make the great salvation known,
    Wide as the human race.


    5. Spirit Divine, attend our prayer,
    And make our hearts thy home;
    Descend with all thy gracious power
    Come, Holy Spirit, come!
