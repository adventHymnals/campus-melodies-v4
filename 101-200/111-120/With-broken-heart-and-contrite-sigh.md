[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ly1n%2DYGtfTBYNc3Yx6qBVaXSi2xg5Inm/edit?mode=html)



    1. With broken heart and contrite sigh,
    A trembling sinner, Lord, I cry;
    Thy pardâ€™ning grace is rich and free;
    O God, be merciful to me!


    2. I smite upon my troubled breast,
    With deep and conscious guilt oppressed;
    Christ and his cross my only plea;
    O God, be merciful to me!


    3. Far off I stand with tearful eyes,
    Nor dare uplift them to the skies;
    But thou dost all my anguish see;
    O God, be merciful to me!


    4. Nor alms, nor deeds that I have done,
    Can for a single sin atone;
    To Calvary alone I flee;
    O God, be merciful to me!


    5. And when, redeemed from sin and hell,
    With all the ransomed throng I dwell,
    My raptured song shall ever be,
    God has been merciful to me!
