[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MK0Fjsmh8bCr7sI5qhjnImJEMaKefnZP/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, humble sinner, in whose breast
    A thousand thoughts revolve,
    Come, with your guilt and fear oppressed,
    And make this last resolve:


    2. I’ll go to Jesus, though my sins
    Like mountains round me close;
    I know his courts, I’ll enter in,
    Whatever may oppose.


    3. Prostrate I’ll lie before his throne,
    And there my guilt confess;
    I’ll tell him, I’m a wretch undone
    Without his sov’reign grace.


    4. Perhaps he will admit my plea,
    Perhaps will hear my prayer;
    ==But if I perish I will pray,
    And perish only there.==
