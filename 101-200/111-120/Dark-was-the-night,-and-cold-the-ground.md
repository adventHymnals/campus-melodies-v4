    1. Dark was the night, and cold the ground
    On which the Lord was laid;
    His sweat like drops of blood ran down;
    In agony he prayed—


    2. Father, remove this bitter cup,
    If such thy sacred will;
    If not, content to drink it up,
    Thy pleasure I fulfill.


    3. Go to the garden, sinner; see
    Those precious drops that flow;
    The heavy load he bore for thee;
    For thee he lies so low.


    4. Then learn of him the cross to bear;
    Thy Father’s will obey;
    And, when temptations press thee near,
    Awake to watch and pray.
