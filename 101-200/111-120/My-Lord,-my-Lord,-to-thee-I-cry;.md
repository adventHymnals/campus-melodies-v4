[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ly2HmKkBtmOi2gC5n%2DOOU728m6TDuNX2/edit?mode=html)



    1. My Lord, my Lord, to thee I cry;
    Thy mercy would I know;
    Thy purifying blood apply,
    And wash me white as snow.


    2. Touch me, and make the leper clean;
    Purge my iniquity;
    Unless thou wash my soul from sin,
    I have no part in thee.


    3. But art thou not already mine?
    Answer, if mine thou art;
    Whisper within, thou Love divine,
    And cheer my drooping heart.
