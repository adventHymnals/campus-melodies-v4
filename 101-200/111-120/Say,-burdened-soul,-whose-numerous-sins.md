[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MInFTZJu15zxwTfVM6Dk0%2DHEXgyzicgr/edit?mode=html)



    1. Say, burdened soul, whose numerous sins
    In dark array are set;
    What canst thou do to mitigate 
    The terrors of thy debt?


    2. Canst thou not love the Friend who died
    That burden to assume?
    Who shrunk not from the crown of thorns, 
    The scourge, the cross, the tomb?


    3. If heavy is thy weight of guilt,
    Thy love must greater be;
    Then he, whose blood for man was spilt, 
    Will shed his peace on thee.
