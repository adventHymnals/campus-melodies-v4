[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LA2_r_4yAd%2DcaRqamNumWsKmiF8l2sSX/edit?mode=html)



    1. Down to the sacred wave,
    The Lord of life was led;
    And he who came our souls to save,
    In Jordan bowed his head.


    2. He taught the solemn way;
    He fixed the holy rite;
    He bade his ransomed ones obey,
    And keep the path of light.


    3. Blest Saviour, we will tread
    In thine appointed way;
    Let glory oâ€™er these scenes be shed,
    And smile on us to-day.
