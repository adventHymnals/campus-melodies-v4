[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQzW%2Dbq0DQG75AVUIvw%2DoxaI98KD81Z8/edit?mode=html)



    1. With willing hearts we tread
    The path the Saviour trod;
    We love thâ€™ example of our Head,
    The glorious Lamb of God.


    2. On thee, on thee alone,
    Our hope and faith rely,
    O thou, who wilt for sin atone,
    Who didst for sinners die!


    3. We trust thy sacrifice;
    To thy dear cross we flee;
    Oh! may we die to sin, and rise
    To life and bliss in thee.
