    1. This rite our blest Redeemer gave
    To all in him believing;
    He bids us seek this hallowed grave,
    To his example cleaving.
    I’ll follow then my glorious Lord,
    Whate’er the ties I sever;
    He saves my soul, he’s left his word
    To guide me now and ever.


    2. For me the cross and shame to bear,
    Dear Saviour, thou wast willing;
    Nor would I shrink thy yoke to wear,
    All righteousness fulfilling.
    I’ll follow, &c.


    3. Jesus, to thee I yield my all;
    In thy kind arms infold me:
    My heart is fixed— no fears appall—
    Thy gracious power shall hold me.
    I’ll follow, &c.
