    1. â€™Tis down into the water
    Where we believers go,
    To serve our Lord and Master
    In righteous acts below;
    We lay our mortal bodies
    Beneath the yielding wave,
    An emblem of the Saviour,
    When he lay in the grave.


    2. The light of truth is spreading,
    And shining now for thee;
    And sweet its notes are sounding
    To set the captive free;
    And while this glorious message
    Is circulated round,
    Some souls exposed to ruin,
    Redeeming grace have found.
