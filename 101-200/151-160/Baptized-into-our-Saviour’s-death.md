[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LiXHLSAtBh1pPhxz_pgsVlpgEPwuZNY_/edit?mode=html)



    1. Baptized into our Saviour’s death,
    Our souls to sin must die;
    With Christ our Lord we live anew,
    With Christ ascend on high.


    2. There by his Father’s side he sits,
    Enthroned divinely fair;
    Yet owns himself our Brother still,
    And our forerunner there.


    3. Rise from these earthly trifles, rise
    On wings of faith and love;
    Above our choicest treasure lies,—
    And be our hearts above.


    4. Let not earth’s pleasures draw us down;
    Oh! give us strength to rise,
    And through thy strong, attractive power,
    At last to gain the prize.
