[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LD67JD8GsoL22goiRomBwOKkcnYL%2D4Rj/edit?mode=html)



    1. Gracious Saviour, we adore thee;
    Purchased by thy precious blood,
    We present ourselves before thee,
    Now to walk the narrow road:
    Saviour, guide usâ€”
    Guide us to the throne of God.


    2. Thou didst mark our path of duty;
    Thou wast laid beneath the wave;
    Thou didst rise in glorious beauty
    From the semblance of the grave:
    We would follow
    Thee who from our sins wilt save.
