[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LZoywqxBKAxcdZD8g3gKuTumVj85trFK/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, Holy Spirit, Dove divine,
    On these baptismal waters shine,
    And teach our hearts, in highest strain,
    To praise the Lamb, for sinners slain.


    2. We love thy name, we love thy laws,
    And joyfully embrace thy cause;
    We love thy cross, the shame, the pain,
    O Lamb of God, for sinners slain.


    3. We sink beneath the mystic flood;
    Oh! bathe us in thy cleansing blood;
    We die to sin, and seek a grave,
    With thee, beneath the yielding wave;


    4. And, as we rise, with thee to live,
    Oh! let the Holy Spirit give
    The sealing unction from above,
    The breath of life, the fire of love.
