    1. Salem’s bright King, Jesus by name,
    In ancient time to Jordan came,
    All righteousness to fill;
    ’Twas there the ancient Baptist stood,
    Whose name was John, a man of God,
    To do his Master’s will.


    2. Down in old Jordan’s rolling stream
    The Baptist led the holy Lamb,
    And there did him baptize;
    Jehovah saw his holy Son,
    And was well pleased in what he’d done,
    And owned him from the skies.


    3. This is my Son, Jehovah cries;
    On him, to rest, the Spirit flies;
    O children, hear ye him!
    Hark! ’tis his voice, behold he cries—
    Repent, believe, and be baptized,
    And Christ will save from sin.


    4. Come, children, come, his voice obey;
    Salem’s bright King has marked the way,
    And has a crown prepared;
    Oh! then arise and give consent;
    Walk in the way that Jesus went,
    And have the great reward.
