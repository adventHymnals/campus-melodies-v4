[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TXw41HI%2DBCJwO4gvWm2xtrCsEwzga1Bk/edit?mode=html)



    1. What shall I render to my God
    For all his kindness shown?s
    My feet shall visit thine abode,
    My songs address thy throne.


    2. Among the saints who fill thy house,
    My offering shall be paid;
    There shall my zeal perform the vows
    My soul in anguish made.


    3. How much is mercy thy delight,
    Thou ever-blessed God!
    How dear thy servants in thy sight!
    How precious is their blood!


    4. How happy all thy servants are!
    How great thy grace to me!
    My life, which thou hast made thy care,
    Lord, I devote to thee.


    5. Now I am thine, forever thine,
    Nor shall my purpose move;
    Thy hand hath loosed my bonds of pain,
    And bound me with thy love.


    6. Here in thy courts I leave my vow,
    And thy rich grace record;
    Witness, ye saints, who hear me now,
    If I forsake the Lord.
 
 

## 2.  'Before Jehovah''s awful throne,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T_6pW8cU_PxruRo6O%2DbYyV0FPCAddKyu/edit?mode=html)



    1. Before Jehovah’s awful throne,
    Ye nations, bow with sacred joy:
    Know that the Lord is God alone:
    He can create, and he destroy.


    2. His sovereign power, without our aid,
    Made us of clay, and formed us men:
    And when, like wandering sheep, we strayed,
    He brought us to his fold again.


    3. We’ll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,
    High as the heavens our voices raise;
    And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
    Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.


    4. Wide as the world is thy command:
    Vast as eternity thy love:
    Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,
    When rolling years shall cease to move.
 
 

## 3.  'Servants of God, in joyful lays,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tfgoa3jW2ZbRYq59_fiavD4eTLvrDpf1/edit?mode=html)



    1. Servants of God, in joyful lays,
    Sing ye the Lord Jehovah’s praise;
    His glorious name let all adore,
    From age to age, for evermore.


    2. Blest be his name, supremely blest,
    From the sun’s rising to its rest,
    Who in the riches of his grace,
    Looks down upon the human race.


    3. He hears the uncomplaining moan
    Of those who sit and weep alone;
    He lifts the mourner from the dust;
    In him the poor may safely trust.


    4. Oh! then, aloud, in joyful lays,
    Sing to the Lord Jehovah’s praise:
    His saving name let all adore,
    From age to age, for evermore.
 
 

## 4.  'Almighty Father, bless the word,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UCd0oqbxnX51XKkROJ1gVVNp8lv7tm%2Dy/edit?mode=html)



    1. Almighty Father, bless the word,
    Which, through thy grace, we now have heard;
    Oh! may the precious seed take root,
    Spring up, and bear abundant fruit.


    2. We praise thee for the means of grace,
    Thus in thy courts to seek thy face;
    Grant, Lord, that we who worship here,
    May all, at length, in Heaven appear.
 
 

## 5.  'High in the heavens, Eternal God,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TN2OnbdXffXcGvl6hquVSjMzRxsiy7KQ/edit?mode=html)



    1. High in the heavens, Eternal God,
    Thy goodness in full glory shines;
    Thy truth shall break through every cloud
    That veils thy just and wise designs.


    2. Forever firm thy justice stands,
    As mountains their foundations keep;
    Wise as the wonders of thy hands,
    Thy judgments are a mighty deep.


    3. O God, how excellent thy grace,
    Whence all our hope and comfort spring!
    The sons of Adam, in distress,
    Fly to the shadow of thy wing.


    4. In the provisions of thy house
    We still shall find a sweet repast;
    There mercy like a river flows,
    And brings salvation to our taste.


    5. Life, like a fountain, rich and free,
    Springs from the presence of my Lord;
    And in thy light our souls shall see
    The glories promised in thy word.
 
 

## 6.  'Lord, grant thy blessing here to-day;'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UGisRwBwDDuJgVdH%2Ddy9e4o0y0Dhht6S/edit?mode=html)



    1. Lord, grant thy blessing here to-day;
    Oh! give thy people joy and peace;
    The tokens of thy love display,
    And favor that shall never cease.


    2. We seek the truth which Jesus brought;
    His path of light we long to tread;
    Here be his holy doctrines taught,
    And here their purest influence shed.


    3. May faith, and hope, and love, abound:
    Our sins and errors be forgiven:
    And we, from day to day, be found
    Children of God and heirs of Heaven.
 
 

## 7.  'Go, preach my gospel, saith the Lord;'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T_Kt%2D06fCDyJaSmVNmdULSb60WY%2DCA0f/edit?mode=html)



    1. Go, preach my gospel, saith the Lord;
    Bid the whole world my grace receive;
    He shall be saved who trusts my word;
    And they condemned who disbelieve.


    2. I’ll make your great commission known,
    And ye shall prove my gospel true
    By all the works that I have done,
    By all the wonders ye shall do.


    3. Teach all the nations my commands;
    I’m with you till the world shall end;
    All power is vested in my hands;
    I can destroy, and I defend.


    4. He spake, and light shone round his head:
    On a bright cloud to Heaven he rode:
    They to the farthest nations spread
    The grace of their ascended Lord.
 
 

## 8.  When I survey the wondrous cross
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2Fba%2DH0qCC3v1Ttn9%2DUNQRLszwhvWhO/edit?mode=html)



    1. When I survey the wondrous cross
    On which the Prince of glory died,
    My richest gain I count but loss,
    And pour contempt on all my pride.


    2. See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
    Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
    Did e’er such love and sorrow meet?
    Or thorns compose so rich a crown?


    3. ==Since I, who was undone and lost,
    Have pardon through his name and word:
    Forbid it, then, that I should boast,
    Save in the cross of Christ, my Lord.==


    4. Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    That were a tribute far too small;
    Love so amazing, so divine,
    Demands my life, my soul, my all.
 
 

## 9.  'JESUS, and shall it ever be,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTD_pCjHozKdA5mzk0JlzGxeM2xK9Qv3/edit?mode=html)



    1. JESUS, and shall it ever be,
    A mortal man ashamed of thee?
    Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise,
    Whose glories shine through endless days?


    2. Ashamed of Jesus! that dear friend
    On whom my hopes of Heaven depend!
    No; when I blush, be this my shame,
    That I no more revere his name.


    3. Ashamed of Jesus! yes, I may,
    When I ’ve no guilt to wash away,
    No tears to wipe, no good to crave,
    No fears to quell, no soul to save.


    4. Till then, nor is my boasting vain,
    Till then, I boast a Saviour slain;
    And, oh! may this my glory be,
    That Christ is not ashamed of me.
 
 

## 10.  'Not all the nobles of the earth,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TOASbYknz61ek%2DDCtnpLLM88QYf%2DRRoI/edit?mode=html)



    1. Not all the nobles of the earth,
    Who boast the honors of their birth,
    So high a dignity can claim,
    As those who bear the Christian name.


    2. To them the privilege is given
    To be the sons and heirs of Heaven;
    Sons of the God who reigns on high,
    And heirs of joy beyond the sky.


    3. He teaches their young feet the way,
    And early leads them to obey;
    Whispers instruction to their minds,
    And on their hearts his precepts binds.


    4. Their daily wants his hands supply,
    Their steps he guards with watchful eye;
    Leads them from earth to Heaven above,
    And crowns them with eternal love.
 
 

## 11.  'Great God, attend, while Zion sings'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SK8GLTqeh5TjIe%2DuWPXWGLesxs41ewNl/edit?mode=html)



    1. Great God, attend, while Zion sings
    The joy that from thy presence springs;
    To spend one day with thee on earth
    Exceeds a thousand days of mirth.


    2. Might I enjoy the humblest place
    Within thy house, O God of grace,
    Not tents of ease, nor thrones of power,
    Should tempt my feet to leave thy door.


    3. God is our sun, he makes our day;
    God is our shield, he guards our way
    From all assaults of hell and sin,
    From foes without and foes within.


    4. All needful grace will God bestow,
    And crown that grace with glory, too;
    He gives us all things, and withholds
    No real good from upright souls.


    5. O God, our King, whose sov’reign sway
    The glorious host of Heaven obey,
    And devils from thy presence flee,
    Blest is the man who trusts in thee.
 
 

## 12.  'How pleasant, how divinely fair,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ry_Lcq57gK7AcF5OSmafTgGX8HzphziF/edit?mode=html)



    1. How pleasant, how divinely fair,
    O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are!
    With long desire my spirit faints
    To meet th’ assemblies of thy saints.


    2. My flesh would rest in thine abode,
    My panting heart cries out for God;
    My God, My King, why should I be
    So far from all my joys and thee?


    3. Blest are the souls that find a place
    Within the temple of thy grace:
    There they behold thy gentler rays,
    And seek thy face, and learn thy praise.


    4. Blest are the men whose hearts are set
    To find the way to Zion’s gate;
    God is their strength: and through the road
    They lean upon their helper, God.
 
 

## 13.  'How sweet to leave the world awhile,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWSctbR8dosHfaXZK%2DMF5VX9f7Xj97NA/edit?mode=html)



    1. How sweet to leave the world awhile,
    And seek the presence of our Lord;
    Dear Saviour, on thy people smile,
    And come according to thy word.


    2. From busy scenes we now retreat,
    That we may here converse with thee
    Ah! Lord, behold us at thy feet;
    Let this the gate of Heaven be.


    3. Chief of ten thousand, now appear,
    That we by faith may see thy face;
    Oh! speak, that we thy voice may hear,
    And let thy presence fill this place.
 
 

## 14.  'From every stormy wind that blows,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SSqLxTNT2_%2DYrVRBQeCgXFZP6xyZ7pzg/edit?mode=html)



    1. From every stormy wind that blows,
    From every swelling tide of woes,
    There is a calm, a sure retreat,
    ’Tis found beneath the mercy-seat.


    2. There is a place where Jesus sheds
    The oil of gladness on our heads;
    A place than all besides more sweet—
    It is the blood-bought mercy-seat.


    3. There is a scene where spirits blend,
    Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
    Though sundered far, by faith they meet
    Around one common mercy-seat.


    4. Ah! whither should we flee for aid,
    When tempted, desolate, dismayed,
    Or how the hosts of hell defeat,
    Had suffering saints no mercy-seat?


    5. There, there on angels’ wings we soar,
    And sin and sense seem all no more;
    The Lord comes down, our souls to greet,
    And glory crowns the mercy-seat.


    6. Oh! let my hand forget her skill,
    My tongue be silent, cold and still,
    This bounding heart forget to beat,
    If I forget the mercy-seat.
 
 

## 15.  'What various hindrances we meet,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ryahmir65FRDgsES2OTliRT7oWBVxpTC/edit?mode=html)



    1. What various hindrances we meet,
    In coming to the mercy-seat;
    Yet, who that knows the worth of prayer,
    But wishes to be often there.


    2. Prayer makes the darkest cloud withdraw;
    Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw,
    Gives exercise to faith and love,
    Brings every blessing from above.


    3. Restraining prayer, we cease to fight;
    Prayer makes the Christian’s armor bright;
    And Satan trembles when he sees
    The weakest saint upon his knees.


    4. When Moses stood with arms spread wide,
    Success was found on Israel’s side;
    But when, through weariness, they failed,
    That moment Amalek prevailed.


    5. Have you no words? Ah! think again;
    Words flow apace when you complain,
    And fill your fellow-creatures’ ears
    With the sad tale of all your cares.


    6. Were half the breath thus vainly spent,
    To Heaven in supplication sent,
    Your cheerful song would oftener be,
    Hear what the Lord hath done for me!
 
 

## 16.  'Oh, for a thousand tongues, to sing'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SH6V50x_KtgT2UL%2D7ScfbRYmelxCXr6p/edit?mode=html)



    1. Oh, for a thousand tongues, to sing
    My great Redeemer’s praise!
    The glories of my God and King,
    The triumphs of his grace.


    2. My gracious Master, and my God,
    Assist me to proclaim,
    To spread through all the earth abroad,
    The honors of thy name.


    3. Jesus, the name that calms our fears,
    That bids our sorrows cease!
    ’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
    ’Tis life, and health, and peace.


    4. He breaks ==the cruel power of sin,==
    He sets the pris’ner free;
    His blood can make the foulest clean;
    His blood avails for me.


    5. He speaks, and list’ning to his voice,
    New life the dead receive;
    The mournful, broken hearts rejoice;
    The humble poor believe.


    6. Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
    Your loosened tongues employ;
    Ye blind, behold your Saviour come;
    And leap, ye lame, for joy.
 
 

## 17.  'How blest the children of the Lord,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1So23LMiEUV7HRcRluQMwALEIwYlucICs/edit?mode=html)



    1. How blest the children of the Lord,
    Who, walking in his sight,
    Make all the precepts of his word
    Their study and delight.


    2. Their works of piety and love
    Performed through Christ, their Lord,
    Forever registered above,
    Shall meet a sure reward.
 
 

## 18.  'With rev''rence let the saints appear,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sgah9iDVd%2D7iDdnM4OgbMHDmEwn1VtjE/edit?mode=html)



    1. With rev’rence let the saints appear,
    And bow before the Lord;
    His high commands with rev’rence hear,
    And tremble at his word.


    2. How terrible thy glories be!
    How bright thine armies shine!
    Where is the power that vies with thee
    Or truth compared with thine?


    3. Sing, all ye ransomed of the Lord,
    Your great Deliv’rer sing;
    Ye pilgrims now for Zion bound,
    Be joyful in your King.


    4. O Jesus, Lord of earth and heaven,
    Our life and joy, to thee
    Be honor, thanks, and blessing given
    Through all eternity.
 
 

## 19.  How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SklV1bZiKr34dobV39uyRSmWACPMZvAa/edit?mode=html)



    1. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
    In a believer’s ear;
    It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
    And drives away his fear.


    2. It makes the wounded spirit whole,
    And calms the troubled breast;
    ’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
    And to the weary, rest.


    3. Jesus, my shepherd, guardian, friend,
    My prophet, priest, and king,
    My Lord, my life, my way, my end,—
    Accept the praise I bring.


    4. Weak is the effort of my heart,
    And cold my warmest thought;
    But, when I see thee as thou art,
    I’ll praise thee as I ought.
 
 

## 20.  Holy and reverend is the name
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SpXolVwkvRz9xWH%2DX5YbrckeCf_mou3H/edit?mode=html)



    1. Holy and reverend is the name
    Of our eternal King;
    Thrice holy Lord! the angels cry;
    Thrice holy! let us sing.


    2. The deepest reverence of the mind,
    Pay, O my soul! to God;
    Lift with thy hands a holy heart
    To his sublime abode.


    3. With sacred awe pronounce his name
    Whom words nor thoughts can reach;
    A broken heart shall please him more
    Than the best forms of speech.


    4. Thou holy God! preserve our souls
    From all pollution free;
    The pure in heart are thy delight,
    And they thy face shall see.
 
 

## 21.  'Come, let us join our cheerful songs'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YGR9FMm5agw14ClrpmaSjML3mJCUSQQC/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, let us join our cheerful songs
    With angels round the throne;
    Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
    But all their joys are one.


    2. Worthy the Lamb who died, they cry,
    To be exalted thus:
    Worthy the Lamb, our hearts reply,
    For he was slain for us.


    3. Jesus is worthy to receive
    Honor and power divine;
    And blessings more than we can give,
    Be, Lord, forever thine.


    4. To Him who reigns in worlds of light,
    The eternal King of Heaven,
    Be honor, majesty, and might,
    And praise and glory given.


    5. Let all creation join in one
    To bless the sacred name
    Of Him who sits upon the throne,
    And to adore the Lamb.
 
 

## 22.  Before the gracious throne we bow
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnoOhKTfzwlbi6v71q9cOwnDDlb2ZhD4/edit?mode=html)



    1. Before the gracious throne we bow
    Of Heaven’s almighty King;
    We here present the solemn vow,
    And hymns of praise we sing.


    2. O Lord, while ==in thy house we kneel,==
    With trust and holy fear;
    Thy mercy and thy truth reveal,
    And lend a gracious ear.


    3. With fervor teach our hearts to pray,
    And tune our lips to sing;
    Nor from thy presence cast away
    The sacrifice we bring.
 
 

## 23.  'Thou art my portion, O my God!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xn35MZovhC7Mep5mQ9OrLCGm1cAvImsR/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thou art my portion, O my God!
    Soon as I know thy way,
    My heart makes haste t’ obey thy word,
    And suffers no delay.


    2. I choose the path of heavenly truth,
    And glory in my choice;
    Not all the riches of the earth
    Could make me so rejoice.


    3. The testimonies of thy grace
    I set before mine eyes;
    Thence I derive my daily strength,
    And there my comfort lies.


    4. If once I wander from thy path,
    I think upon my ways;
    Then turn my feet to thy commands,
    And trust thy pardoning grace.


    5. Now I am thine— forever thine,—
    Oh, save thy servant, Lord!
    Thou art my shield, my hiding-place,
    My hope is in thy word.
 
 

## 24.  'Awake, ye saints, and raise your eyes,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XdePcNLuCQW3M_DY%2DQuqgHQCN_h1pv0h/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awake, ye saints, and raise your eyes,
    And raise your voices high;
    Awake and praise that sovereign love
    That shows salvation nigh.


    2. On all the wings of time it flies;
    Each moment brings it near;
    Then welcome each declining day,
    Welcome each closing year.


    3. Not many years their round shall run,
    Not many mornings rise,
    Ere all its glories stand revealed
    To our admiring eyes.
 
 

## 25.  'Stand up, and bless the Lord,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y8ML7R_t5LvEE8CTSUHKOBwnZKsfMHzs/edit?mode=html)



    1. Stand up, and bless the Lord,
    Ye people of his choice;
    Stand up, and bless the Lord your God,
    With heart, and soul, and voice.


    2. Though high above all praise,
    Above all blessing high,
    Who would not fear his holy name,
    And laud and magnify?


    3. Oh! for the living flame
    From his own altar brought,
    To touch our lips, our souls inspire,
    And wing to Heaven our thought!


    4. God is our strength and song,
    And his salvation ours;
    Then be his love in Christ proclaimed
    With all our ransomed powers.


    5. Stand up, and bless the Lord;
    The Lord your God adore;
    Stand up, and bless his glorious name,
    Henceforth, for evermore.
 
 

## 26.  'How holy God''s commands!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YGI4Nid7RjTvo1oJ044mQgh19FanJUXM/edit?mode=html)



    1. How holy God’s commands!
    How just his precepts are!
    Come, cast your burdens on the Lord,
    And trust his constant care.


    2. Beneath his watchful eye
    His saints securely dwell;
    That hand which bears all nature up,
    Shall guard his children well.


    3. Why should this anxious load
    Press down your weary mind?
    Haste to your Heavenly Father’s throne,
    And sweet refreshment find.


    4. His goodness stands approved
    Through each succeeding day;
    I’ll drop my burden at his feet,
    And bear a song away.
 
 

## 27.  'Come, sound his praise abroad,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xl6myW3mmyZLj0TPP2cBW5StsO2okI07/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, sound his praise abroad,
    And hymns of glory sing;
    Jehovah is the sov’reign God,
    The universal King.


    2. Come, worship at his throne,
    Come, bow before the Lord;
    We are his work, and not our own,
    He formed us by his word.


    3. To-day attend his voice,
    Nor dare provoke his rod;
    Come, like the people of his choice,
    And own your gracious God,
 
 

## 28.  ==Come ye that love the Lord
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xe8B4ALIo7pQrRW4MnnWPbdvpmv_YoPo/edit?mode=html)



    1. ==Come ye that love the Lord
    And let your joys be known;
    Join in a song of sweet accord,
    While ye surround his throne.==


    2. Let those refuse to sing,
    Who never knew our God;
    But servants of the Heavenly King
    May speak their joys abroad.


    3. The God that rules on high,
    That all the earth surveys,
    That rides upon the stormy sky,
    And calms the roaring seas:


    4. This awful God is ours,
    Our Father and our Love;
    He will send down his heavenly powers,
    To carry us above.


    5. There we shall see his face,
    And never, never sin;
    There, from the rivers of his grace
    Drink endless pleasures in.

    The thought of such amazing bliss
    Should constant joys create.

    1. How beauteous are their feet,
    Who stand on Zion’s hill;
    Who bring salvation on their tongues,
    And words of peace reveal!


    2. How charming is their voice,
    So sweet the tidings are:
    “Zion, behold thy Saviour King;
    He reigns and triumphs here!”


    3. How happy are our ears,
    That hear the joyful sound,
    Which kings and prophets waited for,
    And sought, but never found!


    4. How blessed are our eyes,
    That see this heavenly light;
    Prophets and kings desired it long,
    But died without the sight!


    5. The watchmen join their voice,
    And tuneful notes employ;
    Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
    And deserts learn the joy.

    In the day of thine appearing,

    Thine to live, and thine to die.

    Oh, wash me in thy precious blood,

    From the fount of glory beaming,
    Light celestial cheers our eyes,
    Mercy from above proclaiming
    Peace and pardon from the skies.


    2. Who may share this great salvation?
    Every pure and humble mind,
    Every kindred, tongue, and nation,
    From the stains of guilt refined.
    Blessings all around bestowing,
    God withholds his care from none,
    Grace and mercy ever flowing
    From the fountain of his throne.

    1. Long upon the mountains, weary,
    Have the scattered flock been torn;
    Dark the desert paths, and dreary,—
    Grievous trials have they borne.
    Now the gathering call is sounding,
    Solemn in its warning voice;
    Union, faith, and love, abounding,
    Bid the little flock rejoice.


    2. Now the light of truth they’re seeking,
    In its onward track pursue;
    All the ten commandments keeping,
    They are holy, just, and true.
    On the words of life they’re feeding,
    Precious to their taste so sweet;
    All their Master’s precepts heeding,
    Bowing humbly at his feet.


    3. In that world of light and beauty,
    In that golden city fair,
    Soon its pearly gates they’ll enter,
    And of all its glories share.
    There, divine the soul’s expansions;
    Free from sin, and death, and pain;
    Tears will never dim those mansions
    Where the saints immortal reign.


    4. Soon He comes! with clouds descending;
    All his saints, entombed, arise;
    The redeemed in anthems blending
    Shouts of vict’ry through the skies.
    Oh! we long for thine appearing;
    Come, O Saviour! quickly come!
    Blessed hope! our spirits cheering,
    Take thy ransomed children home.

    The star that on Israel shone?
    Say, if in your tents my Beloved has been,
    And where with his flock he has gone.


    3. His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,
    Is heard through the shadows of death;
    The cedars of Lebanon bow at his feet,
    The air is perfumed with his breath.


    4. His lips, as a fountain of righteousness, flow,
    To water the gardens of grace;
    From which, their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
    And bask in the smiles of his face.


    5. He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
    And myriads wait for his word;
    He speaks, and eternity, filled with his voice,
    Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.

    Creator and Ruler o’er all;
    And we are his people, his scepter we own;
    His sheep, and we follow his call.


    3. Oh! enter his gates with thanksgiving and praise,
    Your vows in his temple proclaim!
    His goodness declare in harmonious lays,

    1. O Thou, to whom, in ancient time,
    The psalmist’s sacred harp was strung,
    Whom kings adored in song sublime,
    And prophets praised with glowing tongue,—


    2. Not now on Zion’s height alone 
    Thy favored worshipers may dwell,
    Nor where, at sultry noon, thy Son
    Sat weary by the patriarch’s well.


    3. From every place below the skies,
    The grateful song, the fervent prayer—
    The incense of the heart,—may rise
    To Heaven, and find acceptance there.


    4. To thee shall age, with snowy hair,

    Its praises and its prayers to thee.

    To thee the followers of thy Son
    Have raised, and now devote, these walls.


    2. Here let thy holy days be kept;
    And be this place to worship given,
    Like that bright spot where Jacob slept,
    The house of God, the gate of Heaven.


    3. Here may thine honor dwell; and here
    As incense, let thy children’s prayer,
    From contrite hearts and lips sincere,
    Rise on the still and holy air.


    4. Here be thy praise devoutly sung;
    Here let thy truth beam forth to save,
    As when, of old, thy Spirit hung,
    On wings of light, o’er Jordan’s wave.

    Oh! choose it for thy fixed abode,
    And guard it long from error free.


    2. When here, O Lord, we seek thy face,
    And dying sinners pray to live,
    Hear thou in Heaven, thy dwelling-place,
    And when thou hearest, Lord, forgive.


    3. When here thy messengers proclaim
    The blessed gospel of thy Son,
    Still, by the power of his great name,
    Be mighty signs and wonders done.


    4. And when our voices raise the song,
    Hosanna! to our heavenly King,
    Let Heaven with earth the strain prolong;
    Hosanna! let the angels sing.

    1. God is the refuge of his saints,
    When storms of sharp distress invade:
    Ere we can offer our complaints,
    Behold him present with his aid.


    2. Loud may the troubled ocean roar;
    In sacred peace our souls abide;
    While every nation, every shore,
    Trembles and dreads the swelling tide.


    3. There is a stream whose gentle flow
    Supplies the city of our God;
    Life, love, and joy, still gliding through,
    And watering our divine abode.


    4. Zion enjoys her Monarch’s love,
    Secure against a threatening hour;

    The voice of praise arise;
    And may each lowly service prove
    Accepted sacrifice.

    Here, pardoned, sing a Saviour’s love,
    And here his vows record.

    Oh, smile upon thy people, Lord,

    Worlds his mighty voice obeyed;
    Laws which never shall be broken,
    For their guidance he hath made.


    3. Praise the Lord, for he is glorious;
    Never shall his promise fail;
    God hath made his saints victorious,
    Sin and death shall not prevail.

    Hosts on high his power proclaim;
    Heaven and earth, and all creation,

    1. ’Twas by an order from the Lord
    The ancient prophets spoke his word;
    His Spirit did their tongues inspire,
    And warm their hearts with heavenly fire.


    2. Great God! mine eyes with pleasure look
    On the dear volume of thy book;
    There my Redeemer’s face I see,
    And read his name who died for me.


    3. Let the false raptures of the mind

    1. I love the sacred book of God;
    No other can its place supply;
    It points me to the saints’ abode,
    And bids me from destruction fly.


    2. Sweet book! in thee my eyes discern
    The image of my absent Lord;
    From thine instructive page I learn
    The joys his presence will afford.


    3. But while I’m here, thou shalt supply
    His place, and tell me of his love;
    I’ll read with faith’s discerning eye,
    And thus partake of joys above.


    4. In thee I read my title clear

    Dear Lord, oh, when wilt thou appear,

    1. Let everlasting glories crown
    Thy head, my Saviour and my Lord;
    Thy hands have brought salvation down,
    And stored the blessings in thy word.


    2. In vain the trembling conscience seeks
    Some solid ground to rest upon;
    With deep distress the spirit breaks,
    Till we apply to Christ alone.


    3. How well thy blessed truths agree!
    How wise and holy thy commands!
    Thy promises, how firm they be,
    How sure our hope and comfort stands!


    4. Should all the forms that men devise
    Assault my faith with treach’rous art,
    I’d call them vanity and lies,
    And bind the gospel to my heart.

    And comfort yields to contrite souls;
    It brings a better world in view,
    And guides us all our journey through.

    1. With my whole heart I’ve sought thy face,

    2. Thy word I’ve hid within my heart,
    To keep my conscience clean,
    And be an everlasting guard
    From every rising sin.


    3. My heart with sacred rev’rence hears
    The threatenings of thy word;
    My flesh, with holy trembling, fears
    The judgments of the Lord.


    4. My God! I long, I hope, I wait,
    For thy salvation still;
    While thy whole law is my delight,

    1. A glory in the word we find,
    When grace restores our sight;
    But sin has darkened all the mind,
    And veiled the heavenly light.


    2. When God’s own Spirit clears our view,
    How bright the doctrines shine!
    Their holy fruits and sweetness show
    The Author is divine.


    3. How blest are we, with open face
    To view thy glory, Lord,
    And all thy image here to trace,
    Reflected in thy word!


    4. Oh! teach us, as we look, to grow
    In holiness and love,
    That we may long to see and know
    Thy glorious face above.

    2. Here mines of knowledge, love, and joy,
    Are open to our sight;
    The purest gold without alloy,

    3. The counsels of redeeming grace
    These sacred leaves unfold,
    And here the Saviour’s lovely face
    Our raptured eyes behold.

    To keep the conscience clean.


    2. ’Tis like the sun, a heavenly light,
    That guides us all the day;
    And through the dangers of the night,
    A lamp to lead our way.


    3. Thy precepts make me truly wise;
    I hate the sinner’s road;
    I hate my own vain thoughts that rise,
    But love thy law, my God!


    4. Thy word is everlasting truth;
    How pure is every page!
    That holy book shall guide our youth,
    And well support our age.
 
 

## 57.  'Blessed Bible, how I love it!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VoTkJoJpo1ZxoQCjY_1vI90g1t6ShBw1/edit?mode=html)



    1. Blessed Bible, how I love it!
    How it doth my bosom cheer!
    What hath earth like this to covet?
    Oh! what stores of wealth are here.


    2. ’Tis a fountain ever bursting,
    Whence the weary may obtain
    Water for the soul that’s thirsting,
    And shall never thirst again.


    3. ’Tis a chart that never fails you,
    One which God to man has given;
    And though rudest storms assail you,
    It will guide you safe to Heaven.


    4. ’Tis a pearl of price, exceeding
    All the gems in ocean found;
    To its precepts ever listen,
    In its truths may you abound.
 
 

## 58.  'How perfect is thy word,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJFkNSS%2DY_hnUlxpPwjeAOSeORbL3R6b/edit?mode=html)



    1. How perfect is thy word,
    Thy judgments all are just;
    And ever in thy promise, Lord,
    May man securely trust.


    2. I hear thy word in love,
    In faith thy word obey;
    Oh! send thy Spirit from above,
    To teach me, Lord, thy way.


    3. Thy counsels all are plain,
    Thy precepts all are pure;
    And long as Heaven and earth remain,
    The truth shall still endure.


    4. Oh! may my soul with joy
    Trust in thy faithful word;
    Be it through life my glad employ,
    To keep thy precepts, Lord.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xc61fIf47ZEuC1%2DiyPO9fxXepsaTZOCD/edit?mode=html)



    1. God’s holy law, transgressed,
    Speaks nothing but despair;
    Burdened with guilt, with grief oppressed,
    We find no comfort there.


    2. Not all our groans and tears,
    Nor works which we have done,
    Nor vows, nor promises, nor prayers,
    Can e’er for sin atone.


    3. Relief alone is found
    In Jesus’ precious blood:
    ’Tis this that heals the mortal wound,
    And reconciles to God.


    4. High lifted on the cross,
    The spotless Victim dies;
    This is salvation’s only source,
    Whence all our hopes arise.

    Precious treasure, thou art mine!
    Mine, to tell me whence I came;
    Mine, to teach me what I am;


    2. Mine, to chide me when I rove;
    Mine, to show a Saviour’s love;
    Mine, art thou to guide my feet;
    Mine, to judge, condemn, acquit;


    3. Mine, to comfort in distress,
    If the Holy Spirit bless;
    Mine, to show, by living faith,
    Man can triumph over death;


    4. Mine, to tell of joys to come,
    And the rebel sinner’s doom;
    O thou holy book divine!
    Precious treasure, thou art mine!

    1. Great God! with wonder and with praise,
    On all thy works I look;
    But still thy wisdom, power and grace,
    Shine brightest in thy book.


    2. Lord, make me understand thy law;
    Show what my faults have been;
    And from thy gospel let me draw
    Forgiveness for my sin.


    3. Here I would learn how Christ has died,
    To save my soul from hell;
    Not all the books on earth beside,
    Such heavenly wonders tell.


    4. Here are my choicest treasures hid;
    Here my best comfort lies;
    Here my desires are satisfied;
    And here my hopes arise.


    5. When nature sinks, and spirits droop,
    The promises of grace
    Are pillars to support my hope,
    And there I write thy praise.

    Through all the business of the day,
    To form my actions right.


    2. My heart in midnight silence cries,
    How sweet thy comforts be!
    My thoughts in holy wonder rise,
    And bring their thanks to thee.


    3. And when my spirit drinks her fill
    At some good word of thine,
    Not mighty men that share the spoil,
    Have joys compared with mine.

    1. Come, dearest Lord, and feed thy sheep,
    On this sweet day of rest;
    Oh! bless this flock, and make this fold
    Enjoy a heavenly rest.


    2. Welcome and precious to my soul
    Are these sweet days of love;
    But what a Sabbath shall I keep
    When I shall rest above!


    3. I come, I wait, I hear, I pray;
    Thy footsteps, Lord, I trace;
    Here, in thine own appointed way,
    I wait to see thy face.


    4. These are the sweet and precious days
    On which my Lord I’ve seen,
    And oft, when feasting on his word,
    In raptures I have been.


    5. Oh! if my soul, when Christ appears,
    In this sweet frame be found,
    I’ll clasp my Saviour in mine arms,
    And leave this earthly ground.

    The solace of my care-worn breast.


    2. O sacred day of peace and joy,
    Thy hours are ever dear to me;
    Ne’er may a sinful thought destroy
    The holy calm I find in thee.


    3. How sweetly now they glide along!
    How hallowed is the calm they yield!
    Transporting is their rapturous song,
    And heavenly visions seem revealed.

    Then will thy servant never fail
    To deem thy Sabbath doubly blest.

    1. We’ve entered now on holy time,
    God’s blessed rest-day all divine;
    The labors of the week are past,
    Now let earth’s cares aside be cast.


    2. Oh! let us help repair the breach,
    And all of God’s commandments teach,
    Calling his rest-day our delight,
    Thus walking blameless in his sight.


    3. This holy rest to us is given,
    To call our minds from earth to Heaven;
    That we may not forget the Lord,
    And trample down his holy word.


    4. The faith of Jesus, too, we need;
    For thus the flying angel said:
    Commands of God and Jesus’ faith
    Will shield us in the day of wrath.
 
 

## 67.  'Truth is the gem for which we seek,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WilSGj7QGYF3bqPp5ypNZIOr_ExS3fTS/edit?mode=html)



    1. Truth is the gem for which we seek,
    Oh! tell us where shall it be found;
    For this we search, and pray, and weep,
    That truth may in our hearts abound.


    2. We want the truth on every point;
    We want it all to practice by.
    Do thou, O Lord, our eyes anoint
    With a fresh unction from on high.


    3. Were not the ten commandments given
    By the great Source of light and truth,
    For all who tread the path to Heaven
    From the dark wilderness of earth?


    4. Then, as we would our God obey,
    In letter and in spirit too,
    Oh! let us keep the seventh day,
    For it is plainly brought to view.
 
 

## 68.  'Blest hour, when mortal man retires'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WaOInR1z7bLAYIvX50TdFPXGxoXBYTrO/edit?mode=html)



    1. Blest hour, when mortal man retires
    To hold communion with his God,
    To send to Heaven his warm desires,
    And listen to the sacred word.


    2. Blest hour, when earthly cares resign
    Their empire o’er his anxious breast,
    While all around the calm divine
    Proclaims the holy day of rest.


    3. Blest hour, when God himself draws nigh,
    Well pleased his people’s voice to hear,
    To hush the penitential sigh,
    And wipe away the mourner’s tear.


    4. Blest hour! for, where the Lord resorts,
    Foretastes of future bliss are given;
    And mortals find his earthly courts
    The house of God, the gate of Heaven.

    3. We bless thy name, almighty Lord,
    We love the keepsake thou hast given;
    Our voices raise with one accord,
    In honor of the King of Heaven.


    4. All praise to Jesus, by whose blood
    We are redeemed from sin and death;
    Give glory to the Son of God—
    Praise him all creatures that have breath.


    5. By sin we are exposed to wrath;
    He died for us, that he might draw
    Our wandering feet to virtue’s path,
    Where we may keep God’s holy law.


    6. That law shall still be our delight,
    The holy Sabbath is a part,
    And when we gain that world so bright,
    All flesh shall keep it with one heart.

    1. Sweet is the work, my God, my King,
    To praise thy name, give thanks, and sing;
    To show thy love by morning light,
    And talk of all thy truth by night.


    2. Sweet is the day of sacred rest;
    No mortal cares shall seize my breast;
    Oh! may my heart in tune be found,
    Like David’s harp of solemn sound.


    3. My heart shall triumph in the Lord
    And bless his works, and bless his word;
    Thy works of grace how bright they shine!
    How deep thy counsels, how divine!


    4. When grace has purified my heart,
    Then I shall share a glorious part;
    And fresh supplies of joy be shed,
    Like holy oil to cheer my head.

    When throned in majesty he stood,
    And viewed his works and called them good.


    2. The heavenly host their harps employ,

    This is the day believers prize;
    Improve this Sabbath, then, with care; 
    Another may not be thy share.


    2. Oh, solemn thought! Lord, give me power, 
    Wisely to fill up every hour;
    O h! for the wings of faith and love 
    To bear my longing heart above!


    3. Jesus, assist, nor let me fail
    To worship thee within the vail;
    To glorify thy matchless grace;

    To meet its cares and idle show,
    Thy grace, once more, O God, we crave,
    From folly and from sin to save.


    2. May the great truths we here have heard,
    The lessons of thy holy word,
    Dwell in our inmost bosoms deep,
    And all our souls from error keep.


    3. Oh! may the influence of this day
    Long as our memory with us stay,
    And as an angel guardian prove,
    To guide us to our home above.

    3. Sweet day of rest, through thee
    Shall memory faithful prove
    To Him who made the earth and sea,
    And starry worlds above.

    But there’s a nobler rest above;
    To that our laboring souls aspire,
    With ardent hope and strong desire.


    3. No more fatigue, no more distress,
    No sin nor death can reach that place;
    No tears shall mingle with the songs
    That warble from immortal tongues.


    4. No rude alarm of raging foes,
    No cares to break the long repose,
    No midnight shade, no clouded sun,
    But sacred, high, eternal noon.


    5. O long-expected day, begin,
    Dawn on these realms of woe and sin;
    Fain would I leave this weary road,
    And go to meet my blessed Lord.

    1. Thus far we’re spared again to meet
    Before Jehovah’s mercy-seat;
    To seek his face, to sing and pray,
    And hail another Sabbath day.


    2. Now met to praise his holy name,
    Whose mercies flow each day the same,
    Whose kind compassions never cease,
    We seek instruction, pardon, peace.

    Which bids the burdened soul be free,
    And with united heart and voice,
    Devote these sacred hours to thee.


    3. Now let the world’s delusive things
    No more our groveling thoughts employ,
    But faith be taught to stretch her wings
    In search of Heaven’s unfading joy.


    4. Oh! let these earthly Sabbaths, Lord,
    Be to our lasting welfare blest;
    The purest comfort here afford,
    And fit us for eternal rest.

    Thy law upon my heart;
    Nor let my tongue indulge deceit,

    3. From vanity turn off my eyes;
    Let no corrupt design.
    Nor covetous desires, arise
    Within this soul of mine.


    4. Order my footsteps by thy word,
    And make my heart sincere;
    Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
    But keep my conscience clear.

    2. Great Shepherd of thy people, here!
    Thy presence now display;
    We bow within thy house of prayer;
    Oh! give us hearts to pray.


    3. The clouds which vail thee from our sight
    In pity, Lord, remove;
    Dispose our minds to hear aright
    The message of thy love.


    4. The feeling heart, the melting eye,
    The humble mind bestow;

    3. How sweet the words of peace to hear
    From Him to whom ’tis given
    To wake the penitential tear,
    And lead the way to Heaven!


    4. And if to make our sins depart,
    In vain the will has striven,
    He who regards the inmost heart
    Will send his grace from Heaven.


    5. Then hail, thou sacred, blessed day,
    The best of all the seven,
    When hearts unite their vows to pay

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YnD8xedgnp99tWvaKH94bJaLTVjLIkuh/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thy law is perfect, Lord of light;
    Thy testimonies sure;
    The statutes of thy realm are right,
    And thy commandments pure.


    2. Let these, O God, my soul convert,
    And make thy servant wise;
    Let these be gladness to my heart,
    The dayspring to mine eyes.


    3. By these may I be warned betimes;
    Who knows the guile within?
    Lord, save me from presumptuous crimes, 
    Cleanse me from secret sin.


    4. So may the words my lips express,
    The thoughts that throng my mind,
    O Lord, my strength and righteousness, 
    With thee acceptance find.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkhrdpYCm65T1nuBtesySctunKutoF5M/edit?mode=html)



    1. Blest are the undefiled in heart,
    Whose ways are right and clean;
    Who never from thy law depart,
    But fly from every sin.


    2. Blest are the men who keep thy word,
    And practice thy commands;
    With their whole heart they seek the Lord,
    And serve thee with their hands.


    3. Great is their peace who love thy law;
    How firm their souls abide!
    Nor can a bold temptation draw
    Their steady feet aside.


    4. Then shall my heart have inward joy,
    And keep my face from shame,
    When all thy statutes I obey,
    And honor all thy name.

    1. With joy we hail the sacred day,
    Which God has called his own;
    With joy the summons we obey,
    To worship at his throne.


    2. Thy chosen temple, Lord, how fair!
    Where willing votaries throng
    To breathe the humble, fervent prayer,
    And pour the choral song.


    3. Spirit of grace, O deign to dwell
    Within thy church below;
    Make her in holiness excel,
    With pure devotion glow.


    4. Let peace within her walls be found;
    Let all her sons unite
    To spread with grateful zeal around,
    Her clear and shining light.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YmI0lOtbg51ZlSUjZjOc%2DT1yYoPiGrXu/edit?mode=html)



    1. Dear Lord, we would thy praises sing,
    On this thy holy day;
    With grateful hearts our tribute bring, 
    And to thee homage pay.


    2. This day, which thou for us hast blest
    And set apart as thine;
    This day, when God himself did rest 
    Hath honors all divine.


    3. Lord, we would turn away our feet
    From this thy holy day,
    And call its rest and worship sweet,
    A ot doing our own way.


    4. That we may thus restore the breach
    Which in thy law is made,
    We need thy grace our hearts to teach,
    We need thy Spirit’s aid.


    5. Oh! give us wisdom from above
    To worship thee aright,
    Till we shall meet Him whom we love,
    And faith is lost in sight.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YMj9F9zrs4T2VHU2R4mYzW4ltwlFP%2DpU/edit?mode=html)



    1. When the worn spirit wants repose,
    And sighs her God to seek,
    How sweet to hail the hours that close
    The labors of the week!


    2. How sweet to hail the Sabbath day,
    The day of holy rest;
    From earth’s wild cares to soar away,
    To regions pure and blest.


    3. Sweet day! thine hours too soon will cease;
    Yet, while they gently roll,
    Breathe, heavenly Spirit, source of peace,
    A sabbath o’er my soul.


    4. Soon will my pilgrimage be done,
    The world’s long week be o’er,
    That Sabbath dawn which needs no sun,
    That day which fades no more.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yt%2DDhWh%2Dl2dzblsX_QxgR1hBsmCMe%2D8l/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thy holy Sabbath, Lord,
    Thy people hail with joy;
    And while we wait to hear thy word,
    Let praise our hearts employ.


    2. With sweet delight, the day
    That thou hast called thine own,
    We hail, and all our homage pay
    To thine exalted throne.


    3. Oh! may thy saints be blest;
    Assist us while we pray;
    May we enjoy a holy rest,
    And keep the sacred day.


    4. When Sabbaths here shall end,
    And from these courts we move,
    May we an endless Sabbath spend
    In heavenly courts above.
 
 

## 91.  'Welcome, sweet day of rest,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VScrQtJLho3IG1qZ68cwRyEzzOR0%2DRhV/edit?mode=html)



    1. Welcome, sweet day of rest,
    The day believers prize;
    Welcome to this reviving breast,
    And these rejoicing eyes.


    2. The King himself comes near,
    And feasts his saints to-day;
    Here we may sit, and see him here,
    And love, and praise, and pray.


    3. One day within the place
    Where Christ, my Lord, has been,
    Is sweeter than ten thousand days
    Of folly and of sin.


    4. My willing soul would stay
    In such a frame as this,
    Till called to rise and soar away
    To everlasting bliss.
 
 

## 92.  THE light of Sabbath eve
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VZ9tCOqy8tDvfVPdXpBurzPdlJsUy1cA/edit?mode=html)



    1. THE light of Sabbath eve
    Is fading fast away;
    What record will it for us leave,
    To crown the closing day?


    2. Is it a Sabbath spent,
    Of fruitless time destroyed?
    Or have these moments to us lent,
    Been sacredly employed?


    3. To waste these Sabbath hours,
    Oh! may we never dare;
    Nor desecrate with words of ours
    These sacred days of prayer.


    4. But may our Sabbaths here
    Inspire our hearts with love;
    And prove a blessed foretaste clear,
    Of that sweet rest above.

    1. Safely through another week,
    God has brought us on our way;
    Let us now a blessing seek,
    Waiting in his courts to-day:
    Day of all the week the best!
    Emblem of eternal rest!


    2. While we seek supplies of grace,
    Through the dear Redeemer’s name, 
    Show thy reconciling face,
    Take away our sin and shame;
    From our worldly cares set free,
    May we rest this day in thee.


    3. ==Here we come, thy name to praise;==
    May we feel thy presence n ear;
    May thy glory meet our eyes 
    While we in thy courts appear.
    Here afford us, Lord, a taste 
    Of our everlasting feast.


    4. May thy gospel’s joyful sound
    Conquer sinners, comfort saints;
    Make the fruits of grace abound,
    Bring relief to all complaints:
    Thus may all our Sabbaths be,
    Till we rise to reign with thee.

    1. Hail, thou bright and sacred morn,
    Risen with gladness in thy beams!
    Light, which not of earth is born,
    From thy dawn in glory streams;
    Airs of heaven are breathed around,
    And each place is holy ground.


    2. Great Creator! who this day
    From thy perfect work didst rest;
    By the souls that own thy sway,
    Hallowed be its hours and blest;
    Cares of earth aside be thrown,
    This day given to God alone!
 
 

## 95.  'O day of rest and gladness,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ve932Qw0QVE57WgT7aXaCUF_u5MmbTaV/edit?mode=html)



    1. O day of rest and gladness,
    O day of joy and light,
    O balm of care and sadness,
    Most beautiful, most bright,
    On thee, the high and lowly,
    Bending before the throne,
    Sing, Holy, holy, holy,
    To the Eternal One.


    2. Thou art a port protected
    From storms that round us rise,
    A garden intersected
    With streams of paradise;
    Thou art a cooling fountain
    In life’s dry, dreary sand;
    From thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,
    We view our promised land.


    3. A day of sweet reflection
    Thou art, a day of love;
    A day to raise affection
    From earth to things above.
    New graces ever gaining
    From this our day of rest,
    We seek the rest remaining
    In mansions of the blest.
 
 

## 96.  'Thine holy day''s returning,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VdHvZGIGDdgNwyemhBN7BV3m3bFAqWV4/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thine holy day’s returning,
    Our hearts exult to see,
    And, with devotion burning,
    Ascend, great God, to thee.
    To-day with purest pleasure,
    Our thoughts from earth withdraw;
    We search for heavenly treasure
    We learn thy holy law.


    2. We join to sing thy praises,
    O  God of Sabbath day!
    Each voice in gladness raises 
    Its loudest, sweetest lay. 
    Thy richest mercies sharing— 
    Inspire us with thy love;
    By grace our souls preparing 
    For nobler praise above.
 
 

## 97.  'Closing Sabbath! Ah, how soon'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VSIgHUGHltxXObRBBuUGKxYxVBLGJYjH/edit?mode=html)



    1. Closing Sabbath! Ah, how soon
    Have thy sacred moments passed:
    Scarcely shines the morn, the noon,
    Ere the evening brings thy last!
    And another Sabbath flies—
    Solemn witness! to the skies!


    2. What is the report it bears
    To the secret place of God?
    Does it speak of worldly cares,
    Thoughts which cling to earth’s low sod?
    Or has sweet communion shone
    Through its hours from God alone?


    3. Could we hope the day was spent
    Prayerfully, with constant heart,
    We might yield it up content—,
    Knowing though so soon it part,
    We should see a better day,
    Which could never pass away.


    4. God of Sabbaths! oh, forgive!
    That we use thy gifts so ill;
    Teach us daily how to live,
    That we ever may fulfill
    All thy gracious love designed,
    Giving Sabbaths to mankind.
 
 

## 98.  'The God that made the earth,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vbwa6JMsX8ZmrOpUNbm_EA9HiCRWqen1/edit?mode=html)



    1. The God that made the earth,
    And all the worlds on high,
    Who gave all creatures birth,
    In earth, and sea, and sky,
    After six days in work employed,
    Upon the seventh a rest enjoyed.


    2. The Sabbath day was blest,
    Hallowed and sanctified;
    It was Jehovah’s rest,
    And so it must abide;
    ’Twas set apart before the fall,
    ’Twas made for man, ’twas made for all.


    3. And when from Sinai’s mount,
    Amidst the fire and smoke,
    Jehovah did recount,
    And all his precepts spoke;
    He claimed the rest-day as his own,
    And wrote it with his law on stone.


    4. The Son of God appeared,
    With tidings of great joy;
    God’s precepts he revered,
    He came not to destroy;
    None of the law was set aside,
    But every tittle ratified.


    5. Our Saviour did not die
    To render null and void,
    The law of the Most High,
    Which cannot be destroyed;
    But, bruised for us, our stripes he bore—
    We’ll go in peace and sin no more.


    6. Blessed are they that do
    The Father’s just commands;
    They shall the city view,
    Made not by human hands;
    Its gates will open to the blest,
    And they will share that glorious rest.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKTm_r3UCzW24UbUl7zCd_HWythlCbzx/edit?mode=html)



    1. In thy house while now we sing,
    Tune our hearts, O heavenly King;
    Then our joyful souls shall bless
    Thee, the Lord, our righteousness.


    2. While to thee our prayers ascend,
    Let thine ear in love attend;
    Hear us; for thy Spirit pleads:
    Hear; for Jesus intercedes.


    3. While we hear thy word with awe,
    While we tremble at thy law,
    Let thy gospel’s wondrous love
    Every doubt and fear remove.


    4. ==From thy house when we return,
    Let our hearts within us burn;
    That at evening we may say,
    We have walked with God to-day.==

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VSMlS5HozPaShHRQ6RQo82dDgSZShlvB/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hail, peaceful morn, thy dawn I hail, 
    How do thy hours my mind regale
    With feasts of heavenly joy;
    Nor can I half thy blessings name, 
    Which kindle in my soul a flame,
    And all my powers employ.


    2. How shall I best improve thy hours? 
    Lord, on me shed in copious showers
    Thy Spirit and thy grace;
    That when thy sacred courts I tread, 
    My soul may eat the heavenly bread, 
    And sing Jehovah’s praise.


    3. Thou hallowed season of repose,
    Thou balm to soothe the throbbing woes 
    Of this care-stricken breast;
    Thy sacred hours I’ll ever greet,
    And with the faithful will I meet,
    To taste thy holy rest.


    4. Thus may the Sabbath pass away,
    My best, my holiest, happiest day,
    The sweetest of the seven;
    But yet a rest for saints remains,
    The Sabbath free from ills and pains, 
    Eternal, and in Heaven.

    1. Hail peaceful day! divinely blest!
    Sweetly thy glories would we sing— 
    Memorial of that sacred rest 
    Of vast creation’s mighty King.
    This hallowed time to man was given,
    A foretaste of the bliss of Heaven.


    2. Ye saints awake, with joyful lay,
    Behold its rising light, divine;
    To God your grateful homage pay,
    Its radiant beams around us shine. 
    Welcome the day he calls his own,
    And fervent worship at his throne.


    3. Hark! through the shining courts above,
    What rapturous praises echo now! 
    Around that holy law of love,
    Seraphs in adoration bow;
    Let earth, responsive to the strain,
    Exalt alone Jehovah’s name.


    4. O come, thou bright, immortal day!
    When at his temple all adore 
    His scepter’ s universal sway—
    Observed in glory evermore;
    When Zion shall in triumph reign,
    And Eden bloom on earth again.
 
 

## 102.  'Again the day returns of holy rest,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ooqm8LypMysnNt7fLsKy9U8QIJkYriT8/edit?mode=html)



    1. Again the day returns of holy rest,
    Which, when he made the world, Jehovah blest; 
    When, like his own, he bade our labors cease,
    And all be piety, and all be peace.


    2. Let us devote this consecrated day
    To learn his will, and all we learn obey;
    So shall he hear, when fervently we raise 
    Our supplications and our songs of praise.


    3. Lord of all worlds! incline thy bounteous ear;
    Thy children’s voice in tender mercy hear;
    Bear thy blest promise, fixed as hills, in mind,
    And shed renewing grace on lost mankind.


    4. Father in Heaven! in whom our hopes confide,
    Whose powerdefends us, and whose precepts guide;
    Through life our surest guardian and friend,
    Glory supreme be thine till time shall end.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oa%2DdxC%2DPgJCVn05CNYwhptfczxmXmofK/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hail, happy day! thou day of holy rest—
    What heavenly peace and transport fill our breast!
    When Christ, the Lord of grace, in love descends,
    And kindly holds communion with his friends.


    2. Let earth and all its vanities be gone,
    Move from my sight, and leave my soul alone;
    Its flattering, fading glories I despise,
    And to immortal beauties turn my eyes.


    3. Fain would I mount and penetrate the skies,
    And on my Saviour’s glories fix my eyes;
    Oh! meet my rising soul, thou God of love,
    And waft it to the blissful realms above!


    4. O Son of God, exalted on thy throne,
    Impart that grace which conies from thee alone;
    Thou, by whose love, our light and peace are given,
    Bring us, dear Saviour, to thyself and Heaven.
 
 

## 104.  'Welcome, the Sabbath hour,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OgmNhgPa1JMKj4D1PaZckkLde9Epr6WA/edit?mode=html)



    1. Welcome, the Sabbath hour,
    The holy and the blest!
    With sweet, subduing power,
    It calms the soul to rest;
    And hope and love spring up anew,
    To cheer us on our journey through.


    2. Our only care and aim
    Throughout this hallowed day,
    To glorify thy name,
    And grateful homage pay;
    Advance the glory of thy cause,
    And vindicate thy righteous laws.


    3. Descend, celestial Dove!
    E’en while we wait and sing;
    Come from the throne of love,
    With healing on thy wing;
    With ardent zeal each heart inspire,
    The saints baptize with holy fire.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oz2uF1FOI2bIQ6e1Y%2D0FWpsJIo7VF4Jd/edit?mode=html)



    1. Delay not, delay not; O sinner, draw near:
    The waters of life are now flowing for thee;
    No price is demanded, the Saviour is here,
    Redemption is purchased, salvation is free.


    2. Delay not, delay not, O sinner, to come,
    For mercy still lingers and calls thee to-day;
    Her voice is not heard in the vale of the tomb,—
    Her message, unheeded, will soon pass away.


    3. Delay not, delay not; the Spirit of grace,
    Long grieved and resisted, may take its sad flight;
    And leave thee in darkness to finish thy race,—
    To sink in the gloom of eternity’s night.
 
 

## 106.  '''Tis the last call of mercy, that lingers for thee;'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5p8e2cjHT8_uuj3JKUa7CpdCIoUoaeP/edit?mode=html)



    1. ’Tis the last call of mercy, that lingers for thee;
    O sinner, receive it; to Jesus now flee!
    He often has called thee; but thou hast refused!
    His offered salvation and love are abused!


    2. If thou slightest this warning now offered at last,
    Thine will be the sad mourning—the harvest is passed;
    Salvation I’ve slighted, the summer is o’er,
    And now there is pardon, sweet pardon, no more.


    3. ’Tis the last call of mercy; Oh! turn not away,
    For now swiftly hasteth the dread vengeance day!
    The Spirit invites you, and pleads with you, come;
    Oh! come to life’s waters, nor thirstingly roam.


    4. ’Tis the last call of mercy; Oh! steel not thy heart,
    For now she is rising, from earth to depart!
    The Bride is now calling—ye thirsty souls, come!
    Oh! come with the ransomed; in Heaven there’s room!


    5. ’Tis the last call of mercy, that lingers for thee;
    Break away from thy bondage, O sinner, be free!
    Be not a sad mourner—the harvest is passed,
    The summer is ended—and perish at last.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P8DAOQNpe0X%2DFa3xyIGdu95DZ6NQaYIy/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awaked from sin’s delusive sleep,
    My heavy guilt I feel, and weep;
    Beneath a weight of woes oppressed,
    I come to thee, my Lord, for rest.


    2. Now, from thy throne of grace above,
    Look down upon my soul in love;
    That smile shall sweeten all my pain,
    And make my soul rejoice again.


    3. By thy divine, transforming power,
    My ruined nature now restore;
    And let my life and temper shine,
    In blest resemblance, Lord, to thine.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OuSG%2D5fNeznKx5C_tQFQOsXAhs15lAFw/edit?mode=html)



    1. Broad is the road that leads to death,
    And thousands walk together there;
    But wisdom shows a narrow path,
    With here and there a traveler.


    2. Deny thyself, and take thy cross,
    Is thy Redeemer’s great command;
    Nature must count her gold but dross,
    If she would gain that heavenly land.


    3. The fearful soul that tires and faints,
    And walks the ways of God no more,
    Is but esteemed almost a saint.
    And makes his own destruction sure.


    4. Lord, let not all my hopes be vain;
    Create my heart entirely new;
    Let thy sweet Spirit me sustain—
    Oh! guide me all life’s journey through.
 
 

## 109.  'Show pity, Lord; O Lord, forgive!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBm5NcH9fij4GWciI%2DB53BgTh6Lr_2i1/edit?mode=html)



    1. Show pity, Lord; O Lord, forgive!
    Let a repenting sinner live;
    Are not thy mercies large and free?
    May not the guilty trust in thee?


    2. My crimes, though great, do not surpass
    The power and glory of thy grace;
    Oh, wash my soul from every sin,
    And make my guilty conscience clean!


    3. My lips with shame my sins confess,
    Against thy law, against thy grace;
    Lord, should thy judgment be severe,
    I am condemned, but thou art clear.


    4. Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,
    Whose hope, still hovering round thy word,
    Would light on some sweet promise there,
    Some sure support against despair.
 
 

## 110.  'Come hither, all ye weary souls;'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PDJHLzXEp6mkkfxspl1BiYuiAHnSeX%2D2/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come hither, all ye weary souls;
    Ye heavy-laden sinners, come;
    I’ll give you rest from all your toils,
    And raise you to my heavenly home.


    2. They shall find rest who learn of me;
    I’m of a meek and lowly mind;
    But passion rages like the sea,
    And pride is restless as the wind.


    3. Blest is the man whose shoulders take
    My yoke, and bear it with delight!
    My yoke is easy to his neck,
    My grace shall make the burden light.


    4. Jesus, we come at thy command;
    With faith, and hope, and humble zeal,
    Resign our spirits to thy hand,

## 111.  'Just as I am without one plea,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M9eF0xS5B2adfEDcdxLC7BZjyC1Sb57X/edit?mode=html)



    1. Just as I am— without one plea,
    But that thy blood was shed for me,
    And that thou bidst me come to thee,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


    2. Just as I am— and waiting not 
    To rid my soul of one dark blot,
    To thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot, 
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


    3. Just as I am—though tossed about 
    With many a conflict, many a doubt—
    “Fightings within, and fears without,”
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


    4. Just as I am—poor, wretched, blind— 
    Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
    Yea, all I need, in thee to find;
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


    5. Just as I am— thou wilt receive,
    Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; 
    Because thy promise I believe,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


    6. Just as I am—thy love, I own,
    Has broken every barrier down;
    Now to be thine, and thine alone,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
 

## 112.  'With broken heart and contrite sigh,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ly1n%2DYGtfTBYNc3Yx6qBVaXSi2xg5Inm/edit?mode=html)



    1. With broken heart and contrite sigh,
    A trembling sinner, Lord, I cry;
    Thy pard’ning grace is rich and free;
    O God, be merciful to me!


    2. I smite upon my troubled breast,
    With deep and conscious guilt oppressed;
    Christ and his cross my only plea;
    O God, be merciful to me!


    3. Far off I stand with tearful eyes,
    Nor dare uplift them to the skies;
    But thou dost all my anguish see;
    O God, be merciful to me!


    4. Nor alms, nor deeds that I have done,
    Can for a single sin atone;
    To Calvary alone I flee;
    O God, be merciful to me!


    5. And when, redeemed from sin and hell,
    With all the ransomed throng I dwell,
    My raptured song shall ever be,
    God has been merciful to me!
 
 

## 113.  'Come, weary souls, with sin distressed,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LrcHHOgQZwsFowmX%2DXcHdgzSon50V49M/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, weary souls, with sin distressed,
    The Saviour offers heavenly rest;
    The kind, the gracious call obey,
    And cast your gloomy fears away.


    2. Oppressed with guilt, a painful load,
    Oh, come and spread your woes abroad!
    Divine compassion, mighty love,
    Will all the painful load remove.


    3. Here mercy’s boundless ocean flows,
    To cleanse your guilt, and heal your woes;
    Pardon, and life, and endless peace,
    How rich the gift! how free the grace!


    4. Lord, we accept, with thankful hearts,
    The hopes thy gracious word imparts;
    We come with trembling, yet rejoice,
    And bless the kind, inviting voice.


    5. Dear Saviour, let thy powerful love
    Confirm our faith, our fears remove;
    And sweetly influence every breast,
    And guide us to eternal rest.
 
 

## 114.  'Dark was the night, and cold the ground'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MR2nAKoEF%2DO9%2DxhF%2DxQekAjYUisCY37A/edit?mode=html)



    1. Dark was the night, and cold the ground
    On which the Lord was laid;
    His sweat like drops of blood ran down;
    In agony he prayed—


    2. Father, remove this bitter cup,
    If such thy sacred will;
    If not, content to drink it up,
    Thy pleasure I fulfill.


    3. Go to the garden, sinner; see
    Those precious drops that flow;
    The heavy load he bore for thee;
    For thee he lies so low.


    4. Then learn of him the cross to bear;
    Thy Father’s will obey;
    And, when temptations press thee near,
    Awake to watch and pray.
 
 

## 115.  'Come, humble sinner, in whose breast'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MK0Fjsmh8bCr7sI5qhjnImJEMaKefnZP/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, humble sinner, in whose breast
    A thousand thoughts revolve,
    Come, with your guilt and fear oppressed,
    And make this last resolve:


    2. I’ll go to Jesus, though my sins
    Like mountains round me close;
    I know his courts, I’ll enter in,
    Whatever may oppose.


    3. Prostrate I’ll lie before his throne,
    And there my guilt confess;
    I’ll tell him, I’m a wretch undone
    Without his sov’reign grace.


    4. Perhaps he will admit my plea,
    Perhaps will hear my prayer;
    ==But if I perish I will pray,
    And perish only there.==
 
 

## 116.  'Return, O wanderer, return,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBRf50n_ENa_A%2DRBYLYRORPlNdmXJc3u/edit?mode=html)



    1. Return, O wanderer, return,
    And seek thy Father’s face;
    Those new desires which in thee burn,
    Were kindled by his grace.


    2. Return, O wanderer, return,
    He hears thy humble sigh;
    He sees thy softened spirit mourn,
    When no one else is nigh.


    3. Return, O wanderer, return;
    Thy Saviour bids thee live;
    Come to his cross, and, grateful, learn
    How freely he’ll forgive.


    4. Return, O wanderer, return,
    And wipe the falling tear;
    Thy Father calls— no longer mourn;
    ’Tis love invites thee near.


    5. Return, O wanderer, return;
    Regain thy long-sought rest;
    The Saviour’s melting mercies yearn
    To clasp thee to his breast.
 
 

## 117.  'Say, burdened soul, whose numerous sins'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MInFTZJu15zxwTfVM6Dk0%2DHEXgyzicgr/edit?mode=html)



    1. Say, burdened soul, whose numerous sins
    In dark array are set;
    What canst thou do to mitigate 
    The terrors of thy debt?


    2. Canst thou not love the Friend who died
    That burden to assume?
    Who shrunk not from the crown of thorns, 
    The scourge, the cross, the tomb?


    3. If heavy is thy weight of guilt,
    Thy love must greater be;
    Then he, whose blood for man was spilt, 
    Will shed his peace on thee.
 
 

## 118.  'My Lord, my Lord, to thee I cry;'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ly2HmKkBtmOi2gC5n%2DOOU728m6TDuNX2/edit?mode=html)



    1. My Lord, my Lord, to thee I cry;
    Thy mercy would I know;
    Thy purifying blood apply,
    And wash me white as snow.


    2. Touch me, and make the leper clean;
    Purge my iniquity;
    Unless thou wash my soul from sin,
    I have no part in thee.


    3. But art thou not already mine?
    Answer, if mine thou art;
    Whisper within, thou Love divine,
    And cheer my drooping heart.
 
 

## 119.  'Oh, for a heart to praise my God!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MR_KvdyrJIdBOmYdaqzjL5aOQ5YLrJpX/edit?mode=html)



    1. Oh, for a heart to praise my God!
    A heart from sin set free!
    A heart that’s sprinkled with the blood
    So freely shed for-me!


    2. A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
    My dear Redeemer’s throne;
    Where only Christ is heard to speak,
    Where Jesus reigns alone!


    3. A humble, lowly, contrite heart,
    Believing, true, and clean,
    Which neither life nor death can part
    From him that dwells within.


    4. A heart in every thought renewed,
    And filled with love divine!
    Perfect, and right, and pure, and good,
    A copy, Lord, of thine!


    5. Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
    Come quickly from above;
    Write thy new name upon my heart.
    Thy new, best name of love.
 
 

## 120.  'I seek the mercy-seat,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MI8%2Drm9QP4nIZkM5ZpOglsvWRIKpZtnR/edit?mode=html)



    1. I seek the mercy-seat,
    Where thou dost answer prayer;
    There humbly fall before thy feet,
    For none can perish there.


    2. Thy promise is my plea;
    With this I venture nigh;
    Thou callest burdened souls to thee,
    And such, O Lord, am I.


    3. Bowed down beneath my sin,
    By Satan sorely pressed;
    By wars without and fears within,
    I come to thee for rest.


    4. Be thou my hiding-place;
    That, sheltered near thy side,
    I may rejoice in Jesus’ grace—
    In Jesus crucified.


    5. Oh, wondrous love! to die,
    To bear the cross and shame,
    That guilty sinners, such as I,
    Might plead thy gracious name.
 
 

## 121.  'Now is th'' accepted time,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QI2V26ycQw6kUOBnLXBC6QwF6jz%2Degkk/edit?mode=html)



    1. Now is th’ accepted time,
    Now is the day of grace;
    Now, sinners, come without delay, 
    And seek the Saviour’s face.


    2. Now is th’ accepted time,
    The Saviour calls to-day; 
    To-morrow it may be too late
    Then why should you delay?


    3. Now is th’ accepted time,
    The gospel bids you come;
    And every promise in his word 
    Declares there yet is room.
 
 

## 122.  'Father, I dare believe'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QIQA3ZRV2ebK%2DpJQRqoQ1fILC2CRderN/edit?mode=html)



    1. Father, I dare believe
    Thee merciful and true!
    Thou wilt my guilty soul forgive,
    My fallen soul renew.


    2. Come, then, for Jesus’ sake,
    And bid my heart be clean;
    An end of all my troubles make,
    An end of all my sin.


    3. While at thy cross I lie,
    Jesus, the grace bestow;
    Now thy all-cleansing blood apply,
    And I am white as snow.


    4. I cannot wash my heart,
    But by believing thee,
    And waiting for thy blood t’impart
    The spotless purity.
 
 

## 123.  'Beside the gospel pool,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PxQ61ijT3rtM67H1fvIp1leH7RZJpTAp/edit?mode=html)



    1. Beside the gospel pool,
    Appointed for the poor,
    From day to day my helpless soul
    Hath waited for a cure.


    2. How often have I thought,
    Why should I longer lie?
    Surely the mercy I have sought,
    Is not for such as I.


    3. But whither can I go?
    There is no other pool,
    Where streams of sovereign mercy flow,
    To make a sinner whole.


    4. Still, then, from day to day,
    I’ll wait, and hope, and try;
    Can Jesus hear a sinner pray,
    Yet suffer him to die?


    5. No; he is full of grace,
    And never will permit,
    A soul that fain would see his face
    To perish at his feet.
 
 

## 124.  'Did Christ o''er sinners weep?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QP_PS1xMhk57RVV2Zv4O0SmAKt_Y_i04/edit?mode=html)



    1. Did Christ o’er sinners weep?
    And shall our cheeks be dry?
    Let floods of penitential grief
    Burst forth from every eye.


    2. The Son of God in tears,
    The wond’ring angels see!
    Be thou astonished, O my soul!
    He shed those tears for thee.


    3. He wept that we might weep;
    Each sin demands a tear;
    In Heaven alone no sin is found,
    And there’s no weeping there.
 
 

## 125.  'O Sinner, mark thy fate!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QH6L6GciUWlEwDcNnkdwd7afqzeZHI1b/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Sinner, mark thy fate!
    Soon will the Judge appear;
    And then thy cries will come too late; 
    Too late for God to hear.


    2. The day of mercy gone,
    The Spirit grieved away,
    The cup, long filling, now o’erflown, 
    Demands the vengeful day.


    3. Thy God, insulted, seems
    To draw his glittering sword;
    And o’er thy guilty head it gleams, 
    To vindicate his word.


    4. One only hope I see—
    O sinner, seize it now:
    The blood that Jesus shed for thee
    No other hope hast thou.
 
 

## 126.  'Ah! whither should I go,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PrhcuoR3pscts8NF7XK0aqc__XjxqWKa/edit?mode=html)



    1. Ah! whither should I go,
    Burdened, and sick, and faint?
    To whom should I my trouble show,
    And pour out my complaint?


    2. My Saviour bids me come;
    Ah! why do I delay?
    He calls the weary sinner home,
    And yet from him I stay.


    3. What is it keeps me back,
    From which I cannot part,—
    Which will not let the Saviour take
    Possession of my heart?


    4. I now believe, in thee
    Compassion reigns alone; 
    According to my faith, to me 
    Oh, let it, Lord, be done!
 
 

## 127.  'Sinners, haste to mercy''s gate,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QLpgtlaynhUB0QgfE5gmPm0ooS4cvp%2DO/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sinners, haste to mercy’s gate,
    Strive, oh! strive to enter there;
    Hasten, lest ye come too late,
    Lest in vain shall be your prayer.


    2. Soon the Saviour will arise,
    And forever shut the door:
    Hopeless then will be your cries;
    God will welcome you no more.


    3. From his glorious seat within,
    Zion’s King so long forgot,
    Then will say, Ye slaves of sin,
    Hence depart, I know you not.


    4. Oh! the anguish of that word;
    Anguish which no measure knows;
    Sinners, haste to seek the Lord,
    Ere the door of mercy close.
 
 

## 128.  'Heavy clouds are gathering fast,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q3uKLg5qJuL3JbSldtLtn1_or%2D4Ws95k/edit?mode=html)



    1. Heavy clouds are gathering fast,
    Tokens of destruction sure:
    Sinner, now before the blast,
    Seek a shelter to secure.


    2. Hear you not the distant sound,
    Of the thunder murmuring low?
    Haste thee ere the trembling ground
    Hide thee in the gulf below.


    3. Thousand voices from afar,
    Warn thee of thy coming fate:
    Careless sinner, now beware!
    Haste thee, e’er it be too late!


    4. Crimes in every shape increase;
    Judgments stalk throughout the land;
    Signs are borne on every breeze,
    That destruction is at hand.


    5. Darker clouds will soon arise,
    Louder still the thunders roar,
    Fiercer lightnings pierce the skies—
    But the sinner’s day is o’er.
 
 

## 129.  'Sinner, art thou still secure?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QUCU%2DBX8W8FqrufRLEjcni%2D1LViwu3KM/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sinner, art thou still secure?
    Wilt thou still refuse to pray?
    Can thy heart or hands endure 
    In the Lord’s avenging day?


    2. At his presence nature shakes;
    Earth affrighted hastes to flee;
    Solid mountains melt like wax;
    What will then become of thee?


    3. Who his advent may abide?
    You that glory in your shame,
    Will you find a place to hide,
    When the world is wrapt in flame?
 
 

## 130.  'Saviour, Prince, enthroned above,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q73wlrZGL7kOTn983sg6x02xpzqkGOS9/edit?mode=html)



    1. Saviour, Prince, enthroned above,
    Repentance to impart,
    Give me, through thy dying love,
    The humble, contrite heart;
    Give what I have long implored,
    A portion of thy grief unknown:
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.


    2. For thine own compassion’s sake,
    The gracious wonder show;
    Cast my sins behind thy back,
    And wash me white as snow:
    If thy pity now is stirred,
    If now I do myself bemoan,
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.


    3. See me, Saviour, from above,
    Nor suffer me to die!
    Life, and happiness, and love,
    Drop from thy gracious eye:
    Speak the reconciling word,
    And let thy mercy melt me down:
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.


    4. Clothe me with thy holiness,
    Thy meek humility:
    Put on me thy glorious dress—
    Endue my soul with thee:
    Let thine image be restored,
    Thy name and nature let me prove:
    Fill me with thy fullness, Lord,
    And perfect me in love.
 
 

## 131.  'To-day the Saviour calls!'

    1. To-day the Saviour calls!
    Ye wanderers, come!
    O ye benighted souls,
    Why longer roam?


    2. To-day the Saviour calls!
    Oh! listen now;
    Within these sacred walls,
    To Jesus bow.


    3. To-day the Saviour calls!
    For mercy flee;
    For all the guilty soon
    Must guilty be.


    4. To-day the Saviour calls!
    For refuge fly;
    The storm of vengeance falls;
    Ruin is nigh.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Muzfc9%2DwrmTGHTwidjObKXeFlj9c8ME8/edit?mode=html)



    1. By faith I see the day
    That ends my woes,
    When I shall vict’ry gain
    O’er all my foes.


    2. In yonder realms of light,
    By faith I see
    A crown of glory bright,
    Prepared for me.


    3. Oh! may I soon behold
    That happy day,
    When sorrow, sin, and pain,
    Shall flee away!


    4. Oh! may I ever keep
    The prize in view;
    And through the storms of life
    My way pursue.


    5. Jesus, be thou my guide;
    My steps attend;
    Oh! keep me near thy side;
    Be thou my friend.


    6. Be thou my shield and sun,
    Be thou my guard;
    And, when my work is done,
    My great reward.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1McIZmlahdJgkS40A3W1W0WUZc0UmurXn/edit?mode=html)



    1. ’Tis by the faith of joys to come,
    We walk through deserts dark as night;
    Till we arrive at Heaven, our home.
    Truth is our guide, and faith our light.


    2. The want of sight she well supplies;
    She makes the pearly gates appear;
    Far into distant worlds she pries,
    And brings eternal glories near.


    3. Though lions roar, and tempests blow,
    And rocks and dangers fill the way,
    With joy we tread the desert through,
    While faith inspires a heavenly ray.
 
 

## 134.  'From deep distress and troubled thoughts,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N7EY7Mn3qPYyqT7VIHpmQLBhZx5EonNV/edit?mode=html)



    1. From deep distress and troubled thoughts,
    To thee, my God, I raise my cries;
    If thou severely mark our faults,
    No flesh can stand before thine eyes.


    2. But thou hast built thy throne of grace,
    Dispensing pardons freely there,
    That sinners may approach thy face,
    And hope and love, as well as fear.


    3. As the benighted pilgrims wait,
    And long and wish for breaking day,
    So waits my soul before thy gate;
    When will my God his face display?


    4. My trust is fixed upon thy word,
    Nor shall I trust thy word in vain;
    Let mourning souls address the Lord,
    And find relief from all their pain.


    5. His love is great, and large his grace,
    Through the redemption of his Son;
    He turns our feet from sinful ways,
    And pardons what our hands have done.

    1. Oh, happy day that fixed my choice
    On thee, my Saviour and my God!
    Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
    And tell its raptures all abroad.


    2. ’Tis done, the great transaction’s done;
    I am my Lord’s, and he is mine;
    He drew me, and I followed on,
    Charmed to confess the voice divine.


    3. Now rest, my long-divided heart,
    Fixed on this blissful center, rest,
    Nor ever from thy Lord depart,
    With him of every good possessed.


    4. High Heaven, that heard the solemn vow,
    That vow renewed shall daily hear,
    Till in time’s latest hour I bow,
    And bless at last a bond so dear.

    1. Oh! fo r a faith that w'ill not shrink,
    Though pressed by many a foe;
    That will not tremble on the brink 
    Of poverty or woe;


    2. That will not murmur or complain
    Beneath the chastening rod;
    But in the hour of grief or pain,
    Can lean upon its God.


    3. A faith that shines more bright and clear
    When tempests rage without;
    That when in danger knows no fear,
    In darkness feels no doubt;


    4. That bears unmoved the world’s dread frown,
    Nor heeds its scornful smile,
    That sin’ s wild ocean cannot drown,
    Nor its soft arts beguile.


    5. Lord, give me such a faith as this,
    And then, what’er may come,
    I’ll taste e’en here the hallowed bliss 
    Of an eternal home.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1My6_WMcCuruILhHIH0B9zxxGrgs9v40K/edit?mode=html)



    1. How happy every child of grace,
    Who knows his sins forgiven!
    This earth, he cries, is not my place,
    I seek my place in Heaven;


    2. A country far from mortal sight,
    Yet, oh! by faith I see
    The land of rest, the saint’s delight,
    The Heaven prepared for me.


    3. Oh, what a blessed hope is ours!
    While here on earth we stay,
    We more than taste the heavenly powers,
    And antedate that day.


    4. We feel the resurrection near,
    Our life in Christ concealed,
    And with his glorious presence here
    Our earthen vessels filled.


    5. On Him with rapture I shall gaze,
    Who bought the bliss for me,
    And shout and wonder at his grace
    Through all eternity.
 
 

## 138.  '''Tis faith that purifies the heart;'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MlZiin4N8gSRIVLM05AyPKgoNqcPNtPp/edit?mode=html)



    1. ’Tis faith that purifies the heart;
    ’Tis faith that works by love;
    That bids all sinful joys depart,
    And lifts the thoughts above.


    2. Faith shows the promise fully sealed
    With our Redeemer’s blood;
    It helps our feeble hope to rest
    Upon a faithful God.


    3. This faith shall every fear control,
    By its celestial power,—
    With holy triumph fill the soul
    In strong temptation’s hour.
 
 

## 139.  'Oh! could our thoughts and wishes fly,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MhfHH1pBLlspozQUw7TmiEx0lZNE4793/edit?mode=html)



    1. Oh! could our thoughts and wishes fly,
    Above these gloomy shades,
    To those bright worlds beyond the sky,
    Where sorrow ne’er invades!


    2. There, joys unseen by mortal eyes,
    Or reason’s feeble ray,
    In ever-blooming prospect rise,
    Exposed to no decay.


    3. Lord, send a beam of light divine,
    To guide our upward aim!
    With one reviving look of thine,
    Our languid hearts inflame.


    4. Oh! then, on faith’s sublimest wing,
    Our ardent souls shall rise,
    To those bright scenes, where pleasures spring,
    Immortal in the skies.
 
 

## 140.  With joy we meditate the grace
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MzKLSmy7IguJjk3Z7ixbwM3wasilsFvM/edit?mode=html)



    1. With joy we meditate the grace
    Of our High Priest above;
    His heart is made of tenderness,
    His bosom glows with love.


    2. Touched with a sympathy within,
    He knows our feeble frame;
    He knows what sore temptations mean,
    For he hath felt the same.


    3. He, in the days of feeble flesh,
    Poured out his cries and tears;
    And in his measure feels afresh
    What every member bears.


    4. Then let our humble faith address
    His mercy and his power;
    We shall obtain delivering grace
    In the distressing hour.
 
 

## 141.  'I know that my Redeemer lives,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NlAeXBdtlwKT4QC5pKEjoD4b1NYx_84h/edit?mode=html)



    1. I know that my Redeemer lives,
    And ever prays for me;
    A token of his love he gives,
    A pledge of liberty.


    2. Jesus, I hang upon thy word;
    I steadfastly believe 
    Thou wilt return, and claim me, Lord, 
    And to thyself receive.


    3. Joyful in hope, my spirit soars
    To meet thee from above;
    Thy goodness thankfully adores,
    And sure I taste thy love.


    4. When God is mine, and I am his,
    Of Paradise possessed,
    I taste unutterable bliss,
    And everlasting rest.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNOl%2DMLMFRsWQlSPwPU%2Dsy4GBlOD7KS3/edit?mode=html)



    1. My spirit on thy care,
    Blest Saviour, I recline;
    Thou wilt not leave me to despair,
    For thou art love divine.


    2. In thee I place my trust,
    On thee I calmly rest;
    I know thee good, I know thee just,
    And count thy choice the best.


    3. Whate’er events betide,
    Thy will they all perform;
    Safe in thy breast my head I hide,
    Nor fear the coming storm.


    4. Let good or ill befall,
    It must be good for me,—
    Secure of having thee in all,
    Of having all in thee.
 
 

## 143.  'Give to the winds thy fears,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NmbSpdadUUm0NDrHlBzdB_gKP9T5N_Ff/edit?mode=html)



    1. Give to the winds thy fears,
    Hope and be undismayed;
    God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears,
    He shall lift up thy head.


    2. Through waves, and clouds, and storms,
    He gently clears thy way;
    Wait thou his time, so shall this night
    Soon end in joyous day.


    3. Thou on the Lord rely,
    So safe shalt thou go on;
    Fix on his work thy steadfast eye,
    So shall thy work be done.


    4. No profit canst thou gain,
    By self-consuming care;
    To him commend thy cause, his ear
    Attends the softest prayer.


    5. Still heavy is thy heart?
    Still sink thy spirits down?
    Cast off the weight, let fear depart,
    And every care be gone.
 
 

## 144.  In every trying hour
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NMgic8kFtzTMUzBVAOYWEUEb44OkjIGb/edit?mode=html)



    1. In every trying hour
    My soul to Jesus flies;
    I trust in his almighty power,
    When swelling billows rise.


    2. His comforts bear me up;
    I trust a faithful God;
    The sure foundation of my hope
    Is in my Saviour’s blood.


    3. Loud hallelujahs sing
    To our Redeemer’s name;
    In joy or sorrow, life or death,
    His love is still the same.
 
 

## 145.  'O Thou that hear''st the prayer of faith,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NSe3QYSTstwNgYr4ydUE5jORjJpu%2DimH/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Thou that hear’st the prayer of faith,
    Wilt thou not save a soul from death,
    That casts itself on thee?
    I have no refuge of my own,
    But My to what my Lord hath done,
    And suffered once for me.


    2. Slain in the guilty sinner’s stead,
    His spotless righteousness I plead,
    And his availing blood:
    That righteousness my robe shall be,
    That merit shall atone for me,
    And bring me near to God.


    3. Then save me from the second death,
    The spirit of adoption breathe,
    His consolations send;
    By him some word of life impart,
    And sweetly whisper to my heart,
    Thy Maker is thy friend.


    4. Now, Lord, I would be thine alone;
    Come, take possession of thine own,
    For thou hast set me free;
    Released from Satan’s hard command,
    See all my powers in waiting stand,
    To be employed by thee.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NjYSBxn9bMX6Itg5TJjEcpIBPGbvrM%2D6/edit?mode=html)



    1. Still on the Lord thy burden roll,
    Nor let a care remain;
    His mighty arm shall bear thy soul,
    And all thy griefs sustain. 


    2. Ne’er will the Lord his aid deny
    To those who trust his love;
    And they who on his grace rely,
    Shall sing his praise above.
 
 

## 147.  'Away my unbelieving fear!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NbF23hzcGR_4H2HgT_LmscCNSRKlKMAq/edit?mode=html)



    1. Away my unbelieving fear!
    Fear shall in me no more have place;
    My Saviour doth not yet appear,
    He hides the brightness of his face.
    But shall I therefore let him go,
    And basely to the tempter yield?
    No, in the strength of Jesus, no;
    I never will give up my shield.


    2. Although the vine its fruit deny,
    Although the olive yield no oil,
    The withering fig trees droop and die,
    The fields elude the tiller’s toil,
    The empty stall no herd afford,
    And perish all the bleating race;
    Yet I will triumph in the Lord,
    The God of my salvation praise.


    3. Barren although my soul remain,
    And not one bud of grace appear,
    No fruit of all my toil and pain,
    But sin, and only sin is here;
    Although my gifts and comforts lost,
    My blooming hopes cut off I see,
    Yet will I in my Saviour trust,
    And glory that he died for me.
 
 

## 148.  'Ah! why should doubts and fears arise?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NgxKqeovaa4OXxeJOoTJShGtTHM6E1Tj/edit?mode=html)



    1. Ah! why should doubts and fears arise?
    And sorrows fill my weeping eyes?
    Too slow, alas! the mind receives
    The comforts that the gospel gives.


    2. Oh, for a strong, a lasting faith,
    To credit what th’ Almighty saith!
    T’ embrace the message of his Son,
    And call the joys of Heaven my own.


    3. Then, should the earth’s old pillars shake,
    And all the wheels of nature break,
    My steadfast soul would fear no more
    Than solid rocks when billows roar.
 
 

## 149.  'Arise, my soul, arise,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiTzQV6VotYwOm9qNvV6PIeiooOutrxJ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Arise, my soul, arise,
    Shake off thy guilty fears;
    The bleeding Sacrifice
    In my behalf appears;
    Before the throne my Saviour stands;
    My name is written on his hands.


    2. He ever lives above,
    For me to intercede;
    His all-redeeming love,
    His precious blood to plead;
    His blood was shed for all our race,
    And sprinkles now the throne of grace.


    3. Five bleeding wounds he bears,
    Received on Calvary;
    They pour effectual prayers,
    They strongly speak for me:
    Forgive him, oh! forgive, they cry,
    Nor let the contrite sinner die!


    4. The Father hears him pray,
    His dear, anointed One;
    He cannot turn away
    The presence of his Son;
    His Spirit answers to the blood,
    And tells me I’m a child of God.


    5. To God I’m reconciled;
    His pardoning voice I hear;
    He owns me for his child;
    I can no longer fear;
    With confidence I now draw nigh,
    And Father, Abba Father, cry.

    1. While in this sacred rite of thine,
    Ourselves we offer now,
    Shine o’er the waters, Dove divine, 
    And seal the cheerful vow.


    2. All glory be to Him whose life
    For ours was freely given,
    Who aids us in the spirit’s strife,
    And makes us meet for Heaven.


    3. To thee we gladly now resign
    Our life and all our powers;
    Accept us in this rite divine,
    And bless these hallowed hours.


    4. Oh, may we die to earth and sin,
    Beneath the mystic flood!
    And when we rise may we begin
    To live anew for God.
 
 

## 151.  'Buried beneath the yielding wave,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lb%2DxpSdmt29XFEjWYamRnBkzKY0S0nt4/edit?mode=html)



    1. Buried beneath the yielding wave,
    The great Redeemer lies;
    Faith views him in the watery grave,
    And thence beholds him rise.


    2. Thus do these willing souls, to-day,
    Their ardent zeal express,
    And in the Lord’s appointed way,
    Fulfill all righteousness.


    3. With joy we in his footsteps tread,
    And would his cause maintain—
    Like him be numbered with the dead,
    And with him rise and reign.


    4. His presence oft revives our hearts,
    And drives our fears away;
    When he commands, and strength imparts,
    We cheerfully obey.
 
 

## 152.  'Baptized into our Saviour''s death,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LiXHLSAtBh1pPhxz_pgsVlpgEPwuZNY_/edit?mode=html)



    1. Baptized into our Saviour’s death,
    Our souls to sin must die;
    With Christ our Lord we live anew,
    With Christ ascend on high.


    2. There by his Father’s side he sits,
    Enthroned divinely fair;
    Yet owns himself our Brother still,
    And our forerunner there.


    3. Rise from these earthly trifles, rise
    On wings of faith and love;
    Above our choicest treasure lies,—
    And be our hearts above.


    4. Let not earth’s pleasures draw us down;
    Oh! give us strength to rise,
    And through thy strong, attractive power,
    At last to gain the prize.

    1. This rite our blest Redeemer gave
    To all in him believing;
    He bids us seek this hallowed grave,
    To his example cleaving.
    I’ll follow then my glorious Lord,
    Whate’er the ties I sever;
    He saves my soul, he’s left his word
    To guide me now and ever.


    2. For me the cross and shame to bear,
    Dear Saviour, thou wast willing;
    Nor would I shrink thy yoke to wear,
    All righteousness fulfilling.
    I’ll follow, &c.


    3. Jesus, to thee I yield my all;
    In thy kind arms infold me:
    My heart is fixed— no fears appall—
    Thy gracious power shall hold me.
    I’ll follow, &c.
 
 

## 154.  '''Tis down into the water'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ky5_y3XFgr6DeLV%2DsFrNoT3sDLHBjghY/edit?mode=html)



    1. ’Tis down into the water
    Where we believers go,
    To serve our Lord and Master
    In righteous acts below;
    We lay our mortal bodies
    Beneath the yielding wave,
    An emblem of the Saviour,
    When he lay in the grave.


    2. The light of truth is spreading,
    And shining now for thee;
    And sweet its notes are sounding
    To set the captive free;
    And while this glorious message
    Is circulated round,
    Some souls exposed to ruin,
    Redeeming grace have found.

    1. Salem’s bright King, Jesus by name,
    In ancient time to Jordan came,
    All righteousness to fill;
    ’Twas there the ancient Baptist stood,
    Whose name was John, a man of God,
    To do his Master’s will.


    2. Down in old Jordan’s rolling stream
    The Baptist led the holy Lamb,
    And there did him baptize;
    Jehovah saw his holy Son,
    And was well pleased in what he’d done,
    And owned him from the skies.


    3. This is my Son, Jehovah cries;
    On him, to rest, the Spirit flies;
    O children, hear ye him!
    Hark! ’tis his voice, behold he cries—
    Repent, believe, and be baptized,
    And Christ will save from sin.


    4. Come, children, come, his voice obey;
    Salem’s bright King has marked the way,
    And has a crown prepared;
    Oh! then arise and give consent;
    Walk in the way that Jesus went,
    And have the great reward.

    1. Gracious Saviour, we adore thee;
    Purchased by thy precious blood,
    We present ourselves before thee,
    Now to walk the narrow road:
    Saviour, guide us—
    Guide us to the throne of God.


    2. Thou didst mark our path of duty;
    Thou wast laid beneath the wave;
    Thou didst rise in glorious beauty
    From the semblance of the grave:
    We would follow
    Thee who from our sins wilt save.

    O thou, who wilt for sin atone,

    1. Down to the sacred wave,
    The Lord of life was led;
    And he who came our souls to save,
    In Jordan bowed his head.


    2. He taught the solemn way;
    He fixed the holy rite;
    He bade his ransomed ones obey,
    And keep the path of light.

    And joyfully embrace thy cause;
    We love thy cross, the shame, the pain,
    O Lamb of God, for sinners slain.


    3. We sink beneath the mystic flood;
    Oh! bathe us in thy cleansing blood;
    We die to sin, and seek a grave,
    With thee, beneath the yielding wave;

    Oh! let the Holy Spirit give
    The sealing unction from above,
    The breath of life, the fire of love.

    The Spirit’s cleansing power confess;
    O Saviour, from thy heavenly home,
    Confirm the covenant of thy grace!


    3. How blest the vow we here record!
    How blest the grace we now receive!
    Buried— to rise with Christ our Lord,
    New lives of holiness to live.

    The glorious, suffering Saviour trod;
    He is our pattern— through the wave
    We follow the blest Son of God.

    Which we must take to dwell with God;
    Lead us to Christ— the living way,
    Nor let us from his pastures stray;


    4. Lead us to God— our final rest,—
    To be with him forever blest;
    Lead us to Heaven, its bliss to share—
    Fulness of joy forever there.

    Spread, like the sun, thy beams abroad;
    Oh! show the dangers of the way,

    Turn the darkness into day.


    2. Holy Spirit, power divine,
    Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
    Long has sin, without control,
    Held dominion o’er my soul.


    3. Holy Spirit, joy divine,
    Cheer this saddened heart of mine;
    Bid my many woes depart;
    Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.


    4. Holy Spirit, all divine,
    Dwell within this heart of mine;
    Cast down every idol throne;
    Reign supreme, and reign alone.

    Satan watches to destroy;
    Lord, our foes would fain confound us;
    Oh, for us thy might employ!


    3. On thy word our souls are resting;
    Taught by thee, thy name we love;
    Sweetest of all names is Jesus;
    How it doth our spirits move!

    While we see divine compassion,

    While upon the Lamb we gaze;
    And our thoughts are all of Heaven,

    Till we taste thy full salvation,
    And, unveiled, thy glories see.

    1. ’Tis midnight— and on Olive’s brow,
    The star is dimmed that lately shone;
    ’Tis midnight— in the garden now
    The suffering Saviour prays alone.


    2. ’Tis midnight— and, from all removed,
    The Saviour wrestles lone with fears;
    E’en that disciple whom he loved
    Heeds not his Master’s grief and tears.


    3. ’Tis midnight— and, for others’ guilt,
    The man of sorrows weeps in blood;
    Yet he, who hath in anguish knelt,
    Is not forsaken by his God.


    4. ’Tis midnight— and, from ether plains,
    Is borne the song that angels know;
    Unheard by mortals are the strains
    That sweetly soothe the Saviour’s woe.

    1. ’Twas on that dark, that doleful night,
    When powers of earth and hell arose
    Against the Son, God’s dear delight,
    And friends betrayed him to his foes;


    2. Before the mournful scene began,
    He took the bread, and blessed and brake:
    What love through all his actions ran!
    What wondrous words of grace he spake!


    3. This is my body, broke for sin;
    Receive and eat the living food:
    Then took the cup, and blessed the wine;
    ’Tis the new cov’nant in my blood.


    4. Do this, he said, till time shall end,—
    Meet at my table, and record,
    In mem’ry of your dying Friend,
    The love of your departed Lord.


    5. Jesus, thy feast we celebrate,
    We show thy death, we sing thy name,
    Till thou return, and we shall eat
    The marriage supper of the Lamb.

    1. Thy broken body, gracious Lord!
    Is shadowed by this broken bread;
    The wine which in this cup is poured,
    Points to the blood which thou hast shed.


    2. And while we meet together thus,
    We show that we are one in thee:
    Thy precious blood was shed for us;
    Thy death, O Lord, has set us free.


    3. We have one hope—that thou wilt come:
    Thee in the air we wait to see;
    When thou wilt give thy saints a home,
    And we shall ever reign with thee.

    1. He dies! the Friend of sinners dies!
    Lo! Salem’s daughters weep around;
    A solemn darkness veils the skies,
    A sudden trembling shakes the ground.


    2. Come, saints, and shed your tears anew,
    For him who groaned beneath your load;
    He shed his precious blood for you,
    Then freely be your tears bestowed.


    3. Here’s love and grief beyond degree,
    The Lord of glory dies for men!
    But lo! what sudden joys we see,
    Jesus the dead revives again!


    4. He lives forever, wondrous King,
    Born to redeem, and strong to save;
    Then ask, O death, where is thy sting?
    And where’s thy victory, boasting grave?

    1. How dreadful was the curse that fell
    On sinful man; ’twas death and hell;
    Eternal death, destruction sure:
    Who, who, such portion could endure?


    2. But glory be to God on high!
    Redemption comes, Good news, they cry—
    The holy throng— th’ Anointed One
    Descends to earth, God’s holy Son,


    3. And dies for man, then lives again
    A victor: he the foe hath slain;
    Abolished death— oh, wondrous plan!
    Salvation brought to fallen man.


    4. Oh! may we be the truly wise,
    Who seek with all our hearts this prize;
    Contend no more for earth’s renown,
    But look for an immortal crown.

    1. At thy command, O Lord, our hope,
    We come around thy table here;
    We break the bread, we bless the cup,
    That show thy death till thou appear.


    2. Our faith adores thy bleeding love,
    And trusts for life in One that died;
    We hope for heavenly crowns above,
    From a Redeemer crucified.


    3. Let the vain world pronounce it shame,
    And cast their scandals on thy cause!
    We come to boast our Saviour’s name,
    And make our triumph in his cross.


    4. With joy we tell the scoffing age,—
    He that was dead hath left the tomb;
    He lives above their utmost rage,
    And we are waiting till he come.

    1. Coming Saviour, now in faith,
    We remember still thy death;
    Thou wast broken—thou hast died;
    For us thou wast crucified.


    2. While in faith we drink the wine,
    Of thy blood we see the sign;
    Wash us pure from every stain,
    Thou that comest soon to reign.


    3. Lord, we thus remember thee,
    But we long thy face to see—
    Long to reach our heavenly home;
    Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!


    4. Quickly, thou thyself wilt come;
    Thou wilt raise us to thy throne,
    And thy glories here display
    Through a never-ending day.

    1. Jesus invites his saints
    To meet around his board,
    And sup in mem’ry of the death
    And sufferings of their Lord.


    2. We take the bread and wine,
    As emblems of thy deatli;
    Lord, raise our souls above the sign,
    To feast on thee by faith.


    3. Faith eats the bread of life,
    And drinks the living wine;
    It looks beyond this scene of strife—
    Unites us to the Vine.


    4. Soon shall the night be gone,
    Our Lord will come again;
    The marriage supper of the Lamb
    Will usher in his reign.

    1. With Jesus in our midst,
    We gather round the board;
    Though many, we are one in Christ,
    One body in the Lord.


    2. Our sins were laid on him
    When bruised on Calvary;
    For us he died, and rose again,
    A pledge of victory.


    3. Faith eats the bread of life,
    And drinks the living wine;
    Thus we, in love together knit,
    On Jesus’ breast recline.


    4. Then let our powers unite,
    His glorious name to raise;
    And holy joy fill every mind,
    And every voice be praise.

    1. A parting hymn we sing,
    Around thy table, Lord,
    Again our grateful tribute bring,
    Our solemn vows record.


    2. Here have we seen thy face,
    And felt thy presence here;
    So may the savor of thy grace
    In word and life appear.


    3. The purchase of thy blood—
    By sin no longer led—
    The path our dear Redeemer trod
    May we rejoicing tread.


    4. In self-forgetting love
    Be our communion shown,
    Until we join the church above,
    And know as we are known.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pg64Py5IND46qOcdCHsX9FDXciFlBRVE/edit?mode=html)



    1. There is a fountain filled with blood
    Drawn from Immanuel’s veins;
    And sinners, plunged beneath that flood, 
    Lose all their guilty stains.


    2. E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream
    Thy flowing wounds supply,
    Redeeming love has been my theme,
    And shall be till I die.


    3. And in a nobler, sweeter song,
    I’ll sing thy power to save,
    When this poor, lisping, stam’ring tongue
    Is ransomed from the grave.


    4. Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood
    Shall never lose its power,
    Till all the ransomed church of God
    Be saved, to sin no more.

    1. There is a dear and hallowed spot
    Oft present to my eye;
    By saints it ne’er can be forgot—
    That place is Calvary.


    2. Oh! what a scene was there displayed,
    Of love and agony,
    When our Redeemer bowed his head,
    And died on Calvary.


    3. When fainting under guilt’s dread load,
    Unto the cross I ’ll fly,
    And trust the merits of that blood
    That flowed at Calvary.


    4. Whene’er I feel temptation’s power,
    On Jesus I ’ll rely,
    And in the sharp, conflicting hour
    Repair to Calvary.

    1. O thou, my soul, forget no more
    The Friend who all thy sorrows bore;
    Let every idol be forgot;
    But, O my soul, forget Him not.


    2. Eternal truth and mercy shine
    In him, and he himself is thine;
    And canst thou, then, with sin beset,
    Such charms, such matchless charms, forget?


    3. Oh, no! till life itself depart,
    His name shall cheer and warm my heart-
    And, lisping this, from earth I’ll rise,
    And join the chorus of the skies.

    1. Rock of ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in thee;
    Let the water and the blood,
    From thy wounded side that flowed,
    Be of sin the perfect cure:
    Save me, Lord, and make me pure.


    2. Should my tears forever flow,
    Should my zeal no languor know,
    This, for sin, could not atone:
    Thou must save, and thou alone.
    In my hand no price I bring;
    Simply to thy cross I cling.


    3. When my pilgrimage I close,
    Victor o’er the last of foes,
    When I soar to worlds unknown,
    See thee on thy Judgment throne,
    Rock of ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in thee.

    Bid us feast with joy divine,
    On th’ appointed bread and wine:
    Emblems may they truly prove
    Of our Saviour’s bleeding love.


    3. Weak, unworthy, sinful, vile,
    Yet we seek the heavenly smile;
    Thou canst all our sins forgive;
    Thou canst bid us look and live.
    Lord, we wonder and adore!
    Oh, for grace to love thee more!

    3. Love to God and man displaying,
    Walking steadfast in his way,
    Joy attend us in believing,
    Peace from God, through endless day.
