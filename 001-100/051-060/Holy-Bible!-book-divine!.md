[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRnPfmoqZuj9bYGwImiNtw45_L50buvt/edit?mode=html)



    1. Holy Bible! book divine!
    Precious treasure, thou art mine!
    Mine, to tell me whence I came;
    Mine, to teach me what I am;


    2. Mine, to chide me when I rove;
    Mine, to show a Saviour’s love;
    Mine, art thou to guide my feet;
    Mine, to judge, condemn, acquit;


    3. Mine, to comfort in distress,
    If the Holy Spirit bless;
    Mine, to show, by living faith,
    Man can triumph over death;


    4. Mine, to tell of joys to come,
    And the rebel sinner’s doom;
    O thou holy book divine!
    Precious treasure, thou art mine!
