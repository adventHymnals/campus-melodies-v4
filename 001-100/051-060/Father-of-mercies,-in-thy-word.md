[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XSvcO8FczRoANmjnLseErk%2DdCB_MpAnx/edit?mode=html)



    1. Father of mercies, in thy word
    What endless glory shines!
    Forever be thy name adored
    For these celestial lines.


    2. Here the Redeemer’s welcome voice
    Spreads heavenly peace around;
    And life, and everlasting joys
    Attend the blissful sound.


    3. Jesus, thy word with friendly aid
    Restores our wand’ring feet.
    Converts the sorrows of the mind
    To joys divinely sweet.


    4. Oh! may these heavenly pages be
    My ever dear delight;
    And still new beauties may I see,
    And still increasing light.


    5. Divine Instructor, gracious Lord,
    Be thou forever near;
    Teach me to love thy sacred word,
    And view my Saviour here.
