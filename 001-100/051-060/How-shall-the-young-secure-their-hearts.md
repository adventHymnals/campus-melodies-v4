[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vs_dtfAsnv2sz9QfkrJXL4yhZtZxqex0/edit?mode=html)



    1. How shall the young secure their hearts,
    And guard their lives from sin?
    Thy word the choicest rules imparts
    To keep the conscience clean.


    2. ’Tis like the sun, a heavenly light,
    That guides us all the day;
    And through the dangers of the night,
    A lamp to lead our way.


    3. Thy precepts make me truly wise;
    I hate the sinner’s road;
    I hate my own vain thoughts that rise,
    But love thy law, my God!


    4. Thy word is everlasting truth;
    How pure is every page!
    That holy book shall guide our youth,
    And well support our age.
