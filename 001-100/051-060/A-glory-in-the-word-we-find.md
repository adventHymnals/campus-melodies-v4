## 54.  'A glory in the word we find,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAZLinuBbUPKmv0PR3drFuD%2DDG6OPCN9/edit?mode=html)



    1. A glory in the word we find,
    When grace restores our sight;
    But sin has darkened all the mind,
    And veiled the heavenly light.


    2. When Godâ€™s own Spirit clears our view,
    How bright the doctrines shine!
    Their holy fruits and sweetness show
    The Author is divine.


    3. How blest are we, with open face
    To view thy glory, Lord,
    And all thy image here to trace,
    Reflected in thy word!


    4. Oh! teach us, as we look, to grow
    In holiness and love,
    That we may long to see and know
    Thy glorious face above.
