[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJFkNSS%2DY_hnUlxpPwjeAOSeORbL3R6b/edit?mode=html)



    1. How perfect is thy word,
    Thy judgments all are just;
    And ever in thy promise, Lord,
    May man securely trust.


    2. I hear thy word in love,
    In faith thy word obey;
    Oh! send thy Spirit from above,
    To teach me, Lord, thy way.


    3. Thy counsels all are plain,
    Thy precepts all are pure;
    And long as Heaven and earth remain,
    The truth shall still endure.


    4. Oh! may my soul with joy
    Trust in thy faithful word;
    Be it through life my glad employ,
    To keep thy precepts, Lord.
