## 55.  'Let others boast of wealth or power,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWbUpP6S8V4oG_L6vYEg7%2DwGeDO8w0J1/edit?mode=html)



    1. Let others boast of wealth or power,
    And glory in their pride;
    Thy word, O God, we value more
    Than all the world beside.


    2. Here mines of knowledge, love, and joy,
    Are open to our sight;
    The purest gold without alloy,
    And gems divinely bright.


    3. The counsels of redeeming grace
    These sacred leaves unfold,
    And here the Saviourâ€™s lovely face
    Our raptured eyes behold.


    4. Here light descending from above
    Directs our doubtful feet;
    Here promises of heavenly love
    Our ardent wishes meet.
