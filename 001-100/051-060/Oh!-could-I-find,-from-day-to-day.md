[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XPZEpyJTSdG3fYMPU3dGk3jr2071zmjj/edit?mode=html)



    1. Oh! could I find, from day to day,
    A nearness to my God,
    Then would my hours glide sweet away,
    While leaning on his word.


    2. Lord, I desire with thee to live
    Anew from day to day,
    In joys the world can never give,
    Nor ever take away.


    3. Blest Jesus, come and rule my heart,
    And make me wholly thine,
    That I may never more depart,
    Nor grieve thy love divine.
