    1. Blessed Bible, how I love it!
    How it doth my bosom cheer!
    What hath earth like this to covet?
    Oh! what stores of wealth are here.


    2. ’Tis a fountain ever bursting,
    Whence the weary may obtain
    Water for the soul that’s thirsting,
    And shall never thirst again.


    3. ’Tis a chart that never fails you,
    One which God to man has given;
    And though rudest storms assail you,
    It will guide you safe to Heaven.


    4. ’Tis a pearl of price, exceeding
    All the gems in ocean found;
    To its precepts ever listen,
    In its truths may you abound.
