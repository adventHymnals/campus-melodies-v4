## 59.  'God''s holy law, transgressed,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xc61fIf47ZEuC1%2DiyPO9fxXepsaTZOCD/edit?mode=html)



    1. God’s holy law, transgressed,
    Speaks nothing but despair;
    Burdened with guilt, with grief oppressed,
    We find no comfort there.


    2. Not all our groans and tears,
    Nor works which we have done,
    Nor vows, nor promises, nor prayers,
    Can e’er for sin atone.


    3. Relief alone is found
    In Jesus’ precious blood:
    ’Tis this that heals the mortal wound,
    And reconciles to God.


    4. High lifted on the cross,
    The spotless Victim dies;
    This is salvation’s only source,
    Whence all our hopes arise.
