[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UGisRwBwDDuJgVdH%2Ddy9e4o0y0Dhht6S/edit?mode=html)



    1. Lord, grant thy blessing here to-day;
    Oh! give thy people joy and peace;
    The tokens of thy love display,
    And favor that shall never cease.


    2. We seek the truth which Jesus brought;
    His path of light we long to tread;
    Here be his holy doctrines taught,
    And here their purest influence shed.


    3. May faith, and hope, and love, abound:
    Our sins and errors be forgiven:
    And we, from day to day, be found
    Children of God and heirs of Heaven.
