    1. When I survey the wondrous cross
    On which the Prince of glory died,
    My richest gain I count but loss,
    And pour contempt on all my pride.


    2. See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
    Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
    Did eâ€™er such love and sorrow meet?
    Or thorns compose so rich a crown?


    3. ==Since I, who was undone and lost,
    Have pardon through his name and word:
    Forbid it, then, that I should boast,
    Save in the cross of Christ, my Lord.==


    4. Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    That were a tribute far too small;
    Love so amazing, so divine,
    Demands my life, my soul, my all.
