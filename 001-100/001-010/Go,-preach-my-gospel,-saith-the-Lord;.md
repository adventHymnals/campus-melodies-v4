    1. Go, preach my gospel, saith the Lord;
    Bid the whole world my grace receive;
    He shall be saved who trusts my word;
    And they condemned who disbelieve.


    2. I’ll make your great commission known,
    And ye shall prove my gospel true
    By all the works that I have done,
    By all the wonders ye shall do.


    3. Teach all the nations my commands;
    I’m with you till the world shall end;
    All power is vested in my hands;
    I can destroy, and I defend.


    4. He spake, and light shone round his head:
    On a bright cloud to Heaven he rode:
    They to the farthest nations spread
    The grace of their ascended Lord.
