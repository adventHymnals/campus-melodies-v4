[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TOASbYknz61ek%2DDCtnpLLM88QYf%2DRRoI/edit?mode=html)



    1. Not all the nobles of the earth,
    Who boast the honors of their birth,
    So high a dignity can claim,
    As those who bear the Christian name.


    2. To them the privilege is given
    To be the sons and heirs of Heaven;
    Sons of the God who reigns on high,
    And heirs of joy beyond the sky.


    3. He teaches their young feet the way,
    And early leads them to obey;
    Whispers instruction to their minds,
    And on their hearts his precepts binds.


    4. Their daily wants his hands supply,
    Their steps he guards with watchful eye;
    Leads them from earth to Heaven above,
    And crowns them with eternal love.
