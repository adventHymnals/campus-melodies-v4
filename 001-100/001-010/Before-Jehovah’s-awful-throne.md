    1. Before Jehovah’s awful throne,
    Ye nations, bow with sacred joy:
    Know that the Lord is God alone:
    He can create, and he destroy.


    2. His sovereign power, without our aid,
    Made us of clay, and formed us men:
    And when, like wandering sheep, we strayed,
    He brought us to his fold again.


    3. We’ll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,
    High as the heavens our voices raise;
    And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
    Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.


    4. Wide as the world is thy command:
    Vast as eternity thy love:
    Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,
    When rolling years shall cease to move.
