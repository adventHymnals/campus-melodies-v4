    1. Almighty Father, bless the word,
    Which, through thy grace, we now have heard;
    Oh! may the precious seed take root,
    Spring up, and bear abundant fruit.


    2. We praise thee for the means of grace,
    Thus in thy courts to seek thy face;
    Grant, Lord, that we who worship here,
    May all, at length, in Heaven appear.
