[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKTm_r3UCzW24UbUl7zCd_HWythlCbzx/edit?mode=html)



    1. In thy house while now we sing,
    Tune our hearts, O heavenly King;
    Then our joyful souls shall bless
    Thee, the Lord, our righteousness.


    2. While to thee our prayers ascend,
    Let thine ear in love attend;
    Hear us; for thy Spirit pleads:
    Hear; for Jesus intercedes.


    3. While we hear thy word with awe,
    While we tremble at thy law,
    Let thy gospelâ€™s wondrous love
    Every doubt and fear remove.


    4. ==From thy house when we return,
    Let our hearts within us burn;
    That at evening we may say,
    We have walked with God to-day.==
