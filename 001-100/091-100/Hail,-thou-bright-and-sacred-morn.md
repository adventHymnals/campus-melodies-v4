[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vd8S9DoE5nGnK23aiSnXI36ymEczx48S/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hail, thou bright and sacred morn,
    Risen with gladness in thy beams!
    Light, which not of earth is born,
    From thy dawn in glory streams;
    Airs of heaven are breathed around,
    And each place is holy ground.


    2. Great Creator! who this day
    From thy perfect work didst rest;
    By the souls that own thy sway,
    Hallowed be its hours and blest;
    Cares of earth aside be thrown,
    This day given to God alone!
