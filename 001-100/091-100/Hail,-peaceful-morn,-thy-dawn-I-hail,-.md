[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VSMlS5HozPaShHRQ6RQo82dDgSZShlvB/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hail, peaceful morn, thy dawn I hail, 
    How do thy hours my mind regale
    With feasts of heavenly joy;
    Nor can I half thy blessings name, 
    Which kindle in my soul a flame,
    And all my powers employ.


    2. How shall I best improve thy hours? 
    Lord, on me shed in copious showers
    Thy Spirit and thy grace;
    That when thy sacred courts I tread, 
    My soul may eat the heavenly bread, 
    And sing Jehovah’s praise.


    3. Thou hallowed season of repose,
    Thou balm to soothe the throbbing woes 
    Of this care-stricken breast;
    Thy sacred hours I’ll ever greet,
    And with the faithful will I meet,
    To taste thy holy rest.


    4. Thus may the Sabbath pass away,
    My best, my holiest, happiest day,
    The sweetest of the seven;
    But yet a rest for saints remains,
    The Sabbath free from ills and pains, 
    Eternal, and in Heaven.
