[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ve932Qw0QVE57WgT7aXaCUF_u5MmbTaV/edit?mode=html)



    1. O day of rest and gladness,
    O day of joy and light,
    O balm of care and sadness,
    Most beautiful, most bright,
    On thee, the high and lowly,
    Bending before the throne,
    Sing, Holy, holy, holy,
    To the Eternal One.


    2. Thou art a port protected
    From storms that round us rise,
    A garden intersected
    With streams of paradise;
    Thou art a cooling fountain
    In life’s dry, dreary sand;
    From thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,
    We view our promised land.


    3. A day of sweet reflection
    Thou art, a day of love;
    A day to raise affection
    From earth to things above.
    New graces ever gaining
    From this our day of rest,
    We seek the rest remaining
    In mansions of the blest.
