[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VdHvZGIGDdgNwyemhBN7BV3m3bFAqWV4/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thine holy day’s returning,
    Our hearts exult to see,
    And, with devotion burning,
    Ascend, great God, to thee.
    To-day with purest pleasure,
    Our thoughts from earth withdraw;
    We search for heavenly treasure
    We learn thy holy law.


    2. We join to sing thy praises,
    O  God of Sabbath day!
    Each voice in gladness raises 
    Its loudest, sweetest lay. 
    Thy richest mercies sharing— 
    Inspire us with thy love;
    By grace our souls preparing 
    For nobler praise above.
