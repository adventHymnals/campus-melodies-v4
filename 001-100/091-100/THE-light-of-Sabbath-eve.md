## 92.  THE light of Sabbath eve
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VZ9tCOqy8tDvfVPdXpBurzPdlJsUy1cA/edit?mode=html)



    1. THE light of Sabbath eve
    Is fading fast away;
    What record will it for us leave,
    To crown the closing day?


    2. Is it a Sabbath spent,
    Of fruitless time destroyed?
    Or have these moments to us lent,
    Been sacredly employed?


    3. To waste these Sabbath hours,
    Oh! may we never dare;
    Nor desecrate with words of ours
    These sacred days of prayer.


    4. But may our Sabbaths here
    Inspire our hearts with love;
    And prove a blessed foretaste clear,
    Of that sweet rest above.
