## 12.  'How pleasant, how divinely fair,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ry_Lcq57gK7AcF5OSmafTgGX8HzphziF/edit?mode=html)



    1. How pleasant, how divinely fair,
    O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are!
    With long desire my spirit faints
    To meet th’ assemblies of thy saints.


    2. My flesh would rest in thine abode,
    My panting heart cries out for God;
    My God, My King, why should I be
    So far from all my joys and thee?


    3. Blest are the souls that find a place
    Within the temple of thy grace:
    There they behold thy gentler rays,
    And seek thy face, and learn thy praise.


    4. Blest are the men whose hearts are set
    To find the way to Zion’s gate;
    God is their strength: and through the road
    They lean upon their helper, God.
