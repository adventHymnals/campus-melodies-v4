[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SK8GLTqeh5TjIe%2DuWPXWGLesxs41ewNl/edit?mode=html)



    1. Great God, attend, while Zion sings
    The joy that from thy presence springs;
    To spend one day with thee on earth
    Exceeds a thousand days of mirth.


    2. Might I enjoy the humblest place
    Within thy house, O God of grace,
    Not tents of ease, nor thrones of power,
    Should tempt my feet to leave thy door.


    3. God is our sun, he makes our day;
    God is our shield, he guards our way
    From all assaults of hell and sin,
    From foes without and foes within.


    4. All needful grace will God bestow,
    And crown that grace with glory, too;
    He gives us all things, and withholds
    No real good from upright souls.


    5. O God, our King, whose sovâ€™reign sway
    The glorious host of Heaven obey,
    And devils from thy presence flee,
    Blest is the man who trusts in thee.
