    1. How sweet to leave the world awhile,
    And seek the presence of our Lord;
    Dear Saviour, on thy people smile,
    And come according to thy word.


    2. From busy scenes we now retreat,
    That we may here converse with thee
    Ah! Lord, behold us at thy feet;
    Let this the gate of Heaven be.


    3. Chief of ten thousand, now appear,
    That we by faith may see thy face;
    Oh! speak, that we thy voice may hear,
    And let thy presence fill this place.
