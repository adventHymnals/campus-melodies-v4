[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sgah9iDVd%2D7iDdnM4OgbMHDmEwn1VtjE/edit?mode=html)



    1. With rev’rence let the saints appear,
    And bow before the Lord;
    His high commands with rev’rence hear,
    And tremble at his word.


    2. How terrible thy glories be!
    How bright thine armies shine!
    Where is the power that vies with thee
    Or truth compared with thine?


    3. Sing, all ye ransomed of the Lord,
    Your great Deliv’rer sing;
    Ye pilgrims now for Zion bound,
    Be joyful in your King.


    4. O Jesus, Lord of earth and heaven,
    Our life and joy, to thee
    Be honor, thanks, and blessing given
    Through all eternity.
