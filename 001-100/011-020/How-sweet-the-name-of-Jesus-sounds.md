    1. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
    In a believer’s ear;
    It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
    And drives away his fear.


    2. It makes the wounded spirit whole,
    And calms the troubled breast;
    ’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
    And to the weary, rest.


    3. Jesus, my shepherd, guardian, friend,
    My prophet, priest, and king,
    My Lord, my life, my way, my end,—
    Accept the praise I bring.


    4. Weak is the effort of my heart,
    And cold my warmest thought;
    But, when I see thee as thou art,
    I’ll praise thee as I ought.
