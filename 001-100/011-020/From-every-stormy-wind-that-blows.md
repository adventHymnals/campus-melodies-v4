## 14.  'From every stormy wind that blows,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SSqLxTNT2_%2DYrVRBQeCgXFZP6xyZ7pzg/edit?mode=html)



    1. From every stormy wind that blows,
    From every swelling tide of woes,
    There is a calm, a sure retreat,
    ’Tis found beneath the mercy-seat.


    2. There is a place where Jesus sheds
    The oil of gladness on our heads;
    A place than all besides more sweet—
    It is the blood-bought mercy-seat.


    3. There is a scene where spirits blend,
    Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
    Though sundered far, by faith they meet
    Around one common mercy-seat.


    4. Ah! whither should we flee for aid,
    When tempted, desolate, dismayed,
    Or how the hosts of hell defeat,
    Had suffering saints no mercy-seat?


    5. There, there on angels’ wings we soar,
    And sin and sense seem all no more;
    The Lord comes down, our souls to greet,
    And glory crowns the mercy-seat.


    6. Oh! let my hand forget her skill,
    My tongue be silent, cold and still,
    This bounding heart forget to beat,
    If I forget the mercy-seat.
