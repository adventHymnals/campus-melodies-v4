    1. Holy and reverend is the name
    Of our eternal King;
    Thrice holy Lord! the angels cry;
    Thrice holy! let us sing.


    2. The deepest reverence of the mind,
    Pay, O my soul! to God;
    Lift with thy hands a holy heart
    To his sublime abode.


    3. With sacred awe pronounce his name
    Whom words nor thoughts can reach;
    A broken heart shall please him more
    Than the best forms of speech.


    4. Thou holy God! preserve our souls
    From all pollution free;
    The pure in heart are thy delight,
    And they thy face shall see.
