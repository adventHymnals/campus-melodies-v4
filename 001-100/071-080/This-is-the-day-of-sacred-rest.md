[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T%2DQVa3hTx_npZU0QF3ki7cGx_ySOkeFF/edit?mode=html)



    1. This is the day of sacred rest,
    Which God hath sanctified and blest,
    When throned in majesty he stood,
    And viewed his works and called them good.


    2. The heavenly host their harps employ,
    The sons of God gave shouts of joy;
    Through Heaven and earth his praises rang, 
    The morning stars together sang.


    3. Come, then, ye weary souls oppressed,
    Come and enjoy this holy rest;
    Let humble songs like incense rise,
    And prayer and praise ascend the skies.
