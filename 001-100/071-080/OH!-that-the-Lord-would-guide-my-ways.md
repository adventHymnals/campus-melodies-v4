    1. OH! that the Lord would guide my ways
    To keep his statutes still;
    Oh! that my God would grant me grace
    To know and do his will.


    2. O send thy Spirit down to write
    Thy law upon my heart;
    Nor let my tongue indulge deceit,
    Nor act the liar’s part.


    3. From vanity turn off my eyes;
    Let no corrupt design.
    Nor covetous desires, arise
    Within this soul of mine.


    4. Order my footsteps by thy word,
    And make my heart sincere;
    Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
    But keep my conscience clear.


    5. Make me to walk in thy commands—
    ’Tis a delightful road;
    Nor let my head, nor heart, nor hands,
    Offend against my God.
