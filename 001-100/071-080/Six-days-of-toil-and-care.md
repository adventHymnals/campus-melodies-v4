[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rl9XjN979yTwfLGYs1tdRG2FyTtUAYfD/edit?mode=html)



    1. Six days of toil and care,
    I bid you all adieu;
    And now, O peaceful, Sabbath hours,
    I gladly welcome you.


    2. My heart with rapture turns
    To Eden’s vale so fair;
    Then forward to the heavenly world,
    And views the Sabbath there.


    3. Sweet day of rest, through thee
    Shall memory faithful prove
    To Him who made the earth and sea,
    And starry worlds above.


    4. Each Sabbath spent aright
    Shall bring us nearer thee,
    Till in that glorious land of light
    W e’re made forever free.
