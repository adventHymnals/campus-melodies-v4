## 74.  'Ere to the world again we go,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnZL7LDF4aQJj1wXfrz%2DM_cvsQcdyX_h/edit?mode=html)



    1. Ere to the world again we go,
    To meet its cares and idle show,
    Thy grace, once more, O God, we crave,
    From folly and from sin to save.


    2. May the great truths we here have heard,
    The lessons of thy holy word,
    Dwell in our inmost bosoms deep,
    And all our souls from error keep.


    3. Oh! may the influence of this day
    Long as our memory with us stay,
    And as an angel guardian prove,
    To guide us to our home above.
