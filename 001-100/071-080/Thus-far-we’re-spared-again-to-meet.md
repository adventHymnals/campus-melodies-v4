    1. Thus far we’re spared again to meet
    Before Jehovah’s mercy-seat;
    To seek his face, to sing and pray,
    And hail another Sabbath day.


    2. Now met to praise his holy name,
    Whose mercies flow each day the same,
    Whose kind compassions never cease,
    We seek instruction, pardon, peace.


    3. Let every tongue its silence break,
    Let every one his goodness speak,
    Who deigns his glory to display
    On each returning Sabbath day.
