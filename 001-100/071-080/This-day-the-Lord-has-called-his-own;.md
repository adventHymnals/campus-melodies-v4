    1. This day the Lord has called his own;
    Oh! let us, then, his praise declare;
    Fix our desires on him alone,
    And seek his face with fervent prayer.


    2. Lord, in thy love we would rejoice,
    Which bids the burdened soul be free,
    And with united heart and voice,
    Devote these sacred hours to thee.


    3. Now let the world’s delusive things
    No more our groveling thoughts employ,
    But faith be taught to stretch her wings
    In search of Heaven’s unfading joy.


    4. Oh! let these earthly Sabbaths, Lord,
    Be to our lasting welfare blest;
    The purest comfort here afford,
    And fit us for eternal rest.
