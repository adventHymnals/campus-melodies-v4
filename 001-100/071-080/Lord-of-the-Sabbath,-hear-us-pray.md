[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TArPJZFqJUUZXi5bRv3fIQA4q1S8IM6t/edit?mode=html)



    1. Lord of the Sabbath, hear us pray,
    In this thy house, on this thy day;
    Accept, as grateful sacrifice,
    The songs which from thy temple rise.


    2. Thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord, we love,
    But thereâ€™s a nobler rest above;
    To that our laboring souls aspire,
    With ardent hope and strong desire.


    3. No more fatigue, no more distress,
    No sin nor death can reach that place;
    No tears shall mingle with the songs
    That warble from immortal tongues.


    4. No rude alarm of raging foes,
    No cares to break the long repose,
    No midnight shade, no clouded sun,
    But sacred, high, eternal noon.


    5. O long-expected day, begin,
    Dawn on these realms of woe and sin;
    Fain would I leave this weary road,
    And go to meet my blessed Lord.
