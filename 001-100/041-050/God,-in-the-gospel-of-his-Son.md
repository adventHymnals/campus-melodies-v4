[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZPfZ_vv7t7bWhMhFH%2D_GnIWpv9NQt32V/edit?mode=html)



    1. God, in the gospel of his Son,
    Makes his eternal counsels known;
    â€™Tis here his richest mercy shines,
    And truth is drawn in fairest lines.


    2. Wisdom its dictates here imparts,
    To form our minds, to cheer our hearts;
    Its influence makes the sinner live;
    It bids the drooping saint revive.


    3. Our raging passions it controls,
    And comfort yields to contrite souls;
    It brings a better world in view,
    And guides us all our journey through.
