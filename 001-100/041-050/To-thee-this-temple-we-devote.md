[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSn6V7SeUrqRPOVbKFLvDpfpdyKQpJA2/edit?mode=html)



    1. To thee this temple we devote,
    Our Father and our God;
    Accept it thine, and seal it now
    Thy Spirit’s blest abode.


    2. Here may the prayer of faith ascend,
    The voice of praise arise;
    And may each lowly service prove
    Accepted sacrifice.


    3. Here may the sinner learn his guilt,
    And weep before his Lord;
    Here, pardoned, sing a Saviour’s love,
    And here his vows record.


    4. Peace be within these sacred walls;
    Prosperity be here;
    Oh, smile upon thy people, Lord,
    And evermore be near.
