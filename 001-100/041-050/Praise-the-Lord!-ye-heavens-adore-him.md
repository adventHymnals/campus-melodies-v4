[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZRA2HH%2DjOOjnDkKVCwgeS7eC2B1Dghci/edit?mode=html)



    1. Praise the Lord! ye heavens adore him,
    Praise him, angels in the height;
    Sun and moon rejoice before him:
    Praise him, all ye stars of light!


    2. Praise the Lord, for he hath spoken:
    Worlds his mighty voice obeyed;
    Laws which never shall be broken,
    For their guidance he hath made.


    3. Praise the Lord, for he is glorious;
    Never shall his promise fail;
    God hath made his saints victorious,
    Sin and death shall not prevail.


    4. Praise the God of our salvation,
    Hosts on high his power proclaim;
    Heaven and earth, and all creation,
    Laud and magnify his name.
