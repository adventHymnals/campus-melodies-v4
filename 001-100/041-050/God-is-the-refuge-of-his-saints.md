[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZNDD2RWmS%2Dg_y_WeYreM2saAJsrv%2DydD/edit?mode=html)



    1. God is the refuge of his saints,
    When storms of sharp distress invade:
    Ere we can offer our complaints,
    Behold him present with his aid.


    2. Loud may the troubled ocean roar;
    In sacred peace our souls abide;
    While every nation, every shore,
    Trembles and dreads the swelling tide.


    3. There is a stream whose gentle flow
    Supplies the city of our God;
    Life, love, and joy, still gliding through,
    And watering our divine abode.


    4. Zion enjoys her Monarchâ€™s love,
    Secure against a threatening hour;
    Nor can her firm foundation move.
    Built on his truth, and armed with power.
