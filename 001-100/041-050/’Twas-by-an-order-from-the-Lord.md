    1. ’Twas by an order from the Lord
    The ancient prophets spoke his word;
    His Spirit did their tongues inspire,
    And warm their hearts with heavenly fire.


    2. Great God! mine eyes with pleasure look
    On the dear volume of thy book;
    There my Redeemer’s face I see,
    And read his name who died for me.


    3. Let the false raptures of the mind
    Be lost, and vanish in the wind;
    Here I can fix my hope secure,
    This is thy word, and must endure.
