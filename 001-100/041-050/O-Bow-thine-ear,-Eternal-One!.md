[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zg%2DidM5fDP_fPAFMKkGiaQ8bL_ZP_7uz/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Bow thine ear, Eternal One!
    On thee our heart adoring calls;
    To thee the followers of thy Son
    Have raised, and now devote, these walls.


    2. Here let thy holy days be kept;
    And be this place to worship given,
    Like that bright spot where Jacob slept,
    The house of God, the gate of Heaven.


    3. Here may thine honor dwell; and here
    As incense, let thy children’s prayer,
    From contrite hearts and lips sincere,
    Rise on the still and holy air.


    4. Here be thy praise devoutly sung;
    Here let thy truth beam forth to save,
    As when, of old, thy Spirit hung,
    On wings of light, o’er Jordan’s wave.
