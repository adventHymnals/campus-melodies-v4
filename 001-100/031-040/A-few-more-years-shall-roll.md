[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQ1szg82Jo5T9uFnkQucQ0iK90EkOfBr/edit?mode=html)



    1. A few more years shall roll,
    A few more seasons come;
    And we shall meet the loved who now
    Are sleeping in the tomb:
    Then, O my Lord, prepare
    My soul for that great day;
    Oh, wash me in thy precious blood,
    And take my sins away!


    2. A few more storms shall beat
    On this wild, rocky shore;
    And we shall be where tempests cease,
    And surges swell no more:
    Then, O my Lord, prepare
    My soul for that calm day;
    Oh, wash me in thy precious blood,
    And take my sins away!


    3. A few more struggles here,
    A few more partings sore,
    A few more toils, a few more tears,
    And we shall weep no more:
    Then, O my Lord, prepare
    My soul for that blest day;
    Oh, wash me in thy precious blood,
    And take my sins away!


    4. â€™Tis but a little while,
    And he shall come again,
    Who died, that we might live, who lives
    That we may with him reign:
    Then, O my Lord, prepare
    My soul for that glad day;
    Oh, wash me in thy precious blood,
    And take my sins away!
