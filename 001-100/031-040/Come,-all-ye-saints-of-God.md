[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UVrlAn2SFuSnVvqOrlTnkZ7%2DS59vZI4y/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, all ye saints of God,
    Wide through the earth abroad
    Spread Jesus’ fame:
    Tell what his love hath done;
    Trust in his name alone;
    He is the lofty One,—
    Worthy the Lamb!


    2. Hence, gloomy doubts and fears!
    Dry up your mournful tears;
    Swell the glad theme:
    To Christ, our gracious King,
    Strike each melodious string;
    Join heart and voice to sing,
    Worthy the Lamb!


    3. Hark! how the choirs above,
    Filled with the Saviour’s love,
    Dwell on his name!
    There, too, may we be found,
    With light and glory crowned,
    While all the heavens resound,
    Worthy the Lamb!
