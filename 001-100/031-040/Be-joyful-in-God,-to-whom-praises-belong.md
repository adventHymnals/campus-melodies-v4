[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V12k8PhP5WGuf1B2%2DzQNjRb1986UQ%2DUY/edit?mode=html)



    1. Be joyful in God, to whom praises belong,
    Oh, serve him with gladness and fear;
    Exult in his presence with music and song,
    With love and devotion draw near.


    2. The Lord he is God, and Jehovah alone,
    Creator and Ruler oâ€™er all;
    And we are his people, his scepter we own;
    His sheep, and we follow his call.


    3. Oh! enter his gates with thanksgiving and praise,
    Your vows in his temple proclaim!
    His goodness declare in harmonious lays,
    And bless his adorable name.
