[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ucsb08hZWh9nivt4g3ERMTPwsUChN8UC/edit?mode=html)



    1. Far from mortal cares retreating,
    Sordid hopes and vain desires,
    Here, our willing footsteps meeting,
    Every heart to Heaven aspires.
    From the fount of glory beaming,
    Light celestial cheers our eyes,
    Mercy from above proclaiming
    Peace and pardon from the skies.


    2. Who may share this great salvation?
    Every pure and humble mind,
    Every kindred, tongue, and nation,
    From the stains of guilt refined.
    Blessings all around bestowing,
    God withholds his care from none,
    Grace and mercy ever flowing
    From the fountain of his throne.
