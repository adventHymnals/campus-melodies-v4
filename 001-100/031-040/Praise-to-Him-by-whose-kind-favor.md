    1. Praise to Him by whose kind favor
    Heavenly truth has reached our ears;
    May its sweet reviving savor
    Fill our hearts, and calm our fears.


    2. Truth! how sacred is the treasure!
    Teach us, Lord, its worth to know;
    Vain the hope, and short the pleasure,
    Which from other sources flow.


    3. What of truth we have been hearing,
    Fix, O Lord, in every heart;
    In the day of thine appearing,
    May we share thy peopleâ€™s part.


    4. Till we leave this world forever,
    May we live beneath thine eye;
    This our aim, our sole endeavor,
    Thine to live, and thine to die.
