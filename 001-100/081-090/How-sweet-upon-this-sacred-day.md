[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y_57Nj9GvZBYj4fPdBdvSR_pPtM%2DXcdA/edit?mode=html)



    1. How sweet upon this sacred day,
    The best of all the seven,
    To cast our earthly thoughts away,
    And think of God and Heaven!


    2. How sweet to be allowed to pray,
    Our sins may be forgiven!
    With filial confidence to say,
    “Father, who art in Heaven!”


    3. How sweet the words of peace to hear
    From Him to whom ’tis given
    To wake the penitential tear,
    And lead the way to Heaven!


    4. And if to make our sins depart,
    In vain the will has striven,
    He who regards the inmost heart
    Will send his grace from Heaven.


    5. Then hail, thou sacred, blessed day,
    The best of all the seven,
    When hearts unite their vows to pay
    Of gratitude to Heaven!
