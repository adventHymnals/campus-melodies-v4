[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YnD8xedgnp99tWvaKH94bJaLTVjLIkuh/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thy law is perfect, Lord of light;
    Thy testimonies sure;
    The statutes of thy realm are right,
    And thy commandments pure.


    2. Let these, O God, my soul convert,
    And make thy servant wise;
    Let these be gladness to my heart,
    The dayspring to mine eyes.


    3. By these may I be warned betimes;
    Who knows the guile within?
    Lord, save me from presumptuous crimes, 
    Cleanse me from secret sin.


    4. So may the words my lips express,
    The thoughts that throng my mind,
    O Lord, my strength and righteousness, 
    With thee acceptance find.
