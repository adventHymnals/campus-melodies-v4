## 84.  'Oh! that thy statutes every hour'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YOUMHZt5gIqGHukehw9Kk7s7LoBM2xjM/edit?mode=html)



    1. Oh! that thy statutes every hour
    Might dwell upon my mind;
    Thence I derive a quick’ning power,
    And daily peace I find.


    2. To meditate thy precepts, Lord,
    Shall be my sweet employ;
    My soul shall ne’er forget thy word;
    Thy word is all my joy.


    3. My lips with courage shall declare
    Thy statutes and thy name;
    I’ll speak thy word, though kings should hear,
    Nor yield to sinful shame.
