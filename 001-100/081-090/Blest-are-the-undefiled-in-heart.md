## 86.  'Blest are the undefiled in heart,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkhrdpYCm65T1nuBtesySctunKutoF5M/edit?mode=html)



    1. Blest are the undefiled in heart,
    Whose ways are right and clean;
    Who never from thy law depart,
    But fly from every sin.


    2. Blest are the men who keep thy word,
    And practice thy commands;
    With their whole heart they seek the Lord,
    And serve thee with their hands.


    3. Great is their peace who love thy law;
    How firm their souls abide!
    Nor can a bold temptation draw
    Their steady feet aside.


    4. Then shall my heart have inward joy,
    And keep my face from shame,
    When all thy statutes I obey,
    And honor all thy name.
