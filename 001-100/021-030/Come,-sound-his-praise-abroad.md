[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xl6myW3mmyZLj0TPP2cBW5StsO2okI07/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, sound his praise abroad,
    And hymns of glory sing;
    Jehovah is the sovâ€™reign God,
    The universal King.


    2. Come, worship at his throne,
    Come, bow before the Lord;
    We are his work, and not our own,
    He formed us by his word.


    3. To-day attend his voice,
    Nor dare provoke his rod;
    Come, like the people of his choice,
    And own your gracious God,
