    1. Thou art my portion, O my God!
    Soon as I know thy way,
    My heart makes haste t’ obey thy word,
    And suffers no delay.


    2. I choose the path of heavenly truth,
    And glory in my choice;
    Not all the riches of the earth
    Could make me so rejoice.


    3. The testimonies of thy grace
    I set before mine eyes;
    Thence I derive my daily strength,
    And there my comfort lies.


    4. If once I wander from thy path,
    I think upon my ways;
    Then turn my feet to thy commands,
    And trust thy pardoning grace.


    5. Now I am thine— forever thine,—
    Oh, save thy servant, Lord!
    Thou art my shield, my hiding-place,
    My hope is in thy word.
