[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YGI4Nid7RjTvo1oJ044mQgh19FanJUXM/edit?mode=html)



    1. How holy God’s commands!
    How just his precepts are!
    Come, cast your burdens on the Lord,
    And trust his constant care.


    2. Beneath his watchful eye
    His saints securely dwell;
    That hand which bears all nature up,
    Shall guard his children well.


    3. Why should this anxious load
    Press down your weary mind?
    Haste to your Heavenly Father’s throne,
    And sweet refreshment find.


    4. His goodness stands approved
    Through each succeeding day;
    I’ll drop my burden at his feet,
    And bear a song away.
