    1. Before the gracious throne we bow
    Of Heavenâ€™s almighty King;
    We here present the solemn vow,
    And hymns of praise we sing.


    2. O Lord, while ==in thy house we kneel,==
    With trust and holy fear;
    Thy mercy and thy truth reveal,
    And lend a gracious ear.


    3. With fervor teach our hearts to pray,
    And tune our lips to sing;
    Nor from thy presence cast away
    The sacrifice we bring.
