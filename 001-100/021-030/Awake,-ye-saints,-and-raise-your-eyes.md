## 24.  'Awake, ye saints, and raise your eyes,'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XdePcNLuCQW3M_DY%2DQuqgHQCN_h1pv0h/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awake, ye saints, and raise your eyes,
    And raise your voices high;
    Awake and praise that sovereign love
    That shows salvation nigh.


    2. On all the wings of time it flies;
    Each moment brings it near;
    Then welcome each declining day,
    Welcome each closing year.


    3. Not many years their round shall run,
    Not many mornings rise,
    Ere all its glories stand revealed
    To our admiring eyes.
