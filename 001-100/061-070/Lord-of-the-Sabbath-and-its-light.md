[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vzo8r9C6I6F2nffDY0YHiaODThl61Ttp/edit?mode=html)



    1. Lord of the Sabbath and its light,
    I hail thy hallowed day of rest;
    It is my weary soul’s delight,
    The solace of my care-worn breast.


    2. O sacred day of peace and joy,
    Thy hours are ever dear to me;
    Ne’er may a sinful thought destroy
    The holy calm I find in thee.


    3. How sweetly now they glide along!
    How hallowed is the calm they yield!
    Transporting is their rapturous song,
    And heavenly visions seem revealed.


    4. O Jesus, let me ever hail
    Thy presence with the day of rest;
    Then will thy servant never fail
    To deem thy Sabbath doubly blest.
