[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X22A%2DHDShlfQHCLuB6d7yNR%2DwPXS8VCw/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, dearest Lord, and feed thy sheep,
    On this sweet day of rest;
    Oh! bless this flock, and make this fold
    Enjoy a heavenly rest.


    2. Welcome and precious to my soul
    Are these sweet days of love;
    But what a Sabbath shall I keep
    When I shall rest above!


    3. I come, I wait, I hear, I pray;
    Thy footsteps, Lord, I trace;
    Here, in thine own appointed way,
    I wait to see thy face.


    4. These are the sweet and precious days
    On which my Lord I’ve seen,
    And oft, when feasting on his word,
    In raptures I have been.


    5. Oh! if my soul, when Christ appears,
    In this sweet frame be found,
    I’ll clasp my Saviour in mine arms,
    And leave this earthly ground.
