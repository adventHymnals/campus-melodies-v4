[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnnWsIcGJMOUnE%2DUdGfBh08WBrA1Cww7/edit?mode=html)



    1. I Love thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord,
    For they are days of holy rest,
    And thou hast passed thy changeless word,
    That they shall be forever blest.


    2. I love thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord,
    That congregate thy people here,
    To join their hearts in sweet accord,
    And fit them for a higher sphere.
