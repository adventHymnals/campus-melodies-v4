[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X7V67YNLMPGmXoj3ngQpf4V1iG9fvCwS/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thou book of life, in thee are found
    The mysteries of my Maker’s will;
    Treasures of knowledge here abound,
    The deepest, loftiest mind to fill.


    2. Light of the world, thy beams impart
    To lead my feet through life’s dark way;
    Oh! shine on this benighted heart,
    Nor let me from thy guidance stray.
