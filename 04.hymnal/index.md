### 1. A FEW MORE YEARS SHALL ROLL 

_1 A few more years shall roll, A few more seasons come, 
And we shall be with those that rest Asleep within the tomb: 
Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that great day; 
O wash me in thy precious blood, And take my sins away.

_2 A few more storms shall beat On this wild rocky shore, 
And we shall be where tempests cease, And surges swell no more: 
Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that great day; (&c)
O wash me in thy precious blood, And take my sins away. (&c)

_3 A few more struggle here, A few more partings sore, 
A few more tears, a few more toils, And we shall weep no more: 
Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that great day; (&c)
O wash me in thy precious blood, And take my sins away.(&c)

### 2. ABIDE WITH ME 
#### Author: Henry F. Lyte 

_1 Abide with me, fast falls the eventide; 
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide! 
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, 
Help of the helpless, O abide with me!

_2 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day 
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away 
Change and decay in all around I see; 
O Thou, who changest not, abide with me! 

_3 I need Thy presence every passing hour; 
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power? 
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be? 
Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!

_4 I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless; 
Ills have no weight,and tears no bitterness: 
Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory? 
I triumph still if Thou abide with me!

### 3. ALL HAIL THE POWER OF JESUS' NAME 
#### Author: Edward Perronet 

_1 All hail the power of Jesus' name! Let angels prostrate fall; 
Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all. 
Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all. (&c_l)

_2 Ye chosen seed of Israel's race, ye ransomed from the fall, 
Hail Him who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all. 
Hail Him who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all. (&c_l)

_3 Let every kindred, every tribe on this terrestrial ball 
To Him all majesty ascribe, and crown Him Lord of all. 
To Him all majesty ascribe, and crown Him Lord of all. (&c_l)

### 4. ALL THE WAY
#### Author: Fanny J. Crosby

_1 All the way my Savior leads me; 
 What have I to ask beside? 
Can I doubt His tender mercy, 
Who through life has been my guide? 
Heavenly peace, divinest comfort, 
Here by faith in Him to dwell; 
For I know whate'er befall me, 
Jesus doeth all things well; 
For I know whate'er befall me, 
Jesus doeth all things well. (&c_l)

_2 All the way my Savior leads me; 
Cheers each winding path I tread; 
Gives me grace for every trial, 
Feeds me with the living bread; 
Though my weary steps may falter, 
And my soul athirst may be, 
Gushing from the Rock before me, 
Lo, a spring of joy I see; 
Gushing from the Rock before me, 
Lo, a spring of joy I see. (&c_l)

_3 All the way my Savior leads me; O the fullness of His love! 
Perfect rest to me is promised In my Father's house above; 
When I wake to life immortal,
Wing my flight to realms of day,
This my song thro’ endless ages
Jesus led me all the way;
This my song thro’ endless ages (&c_l)
Jesus led me all the way. (&c_l)

### 5. AMAZING GRACE!
#### Author: John Newton

_1 Amazing grace! how sweet the sound, 
That saved a wretch like me! 
I once was lost, but now am found, 
Was blind, but now I see.

_2 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace my fears relieved 
How precious did that grace appear 
The hour I first believed

_3 Through many dangers, toils, and snares, 
I have already come; 
'Tis grace that brought me save thus far, 
And grace will lead me home.

### 6. ANYWHERE WITH JESUS
#### Author: Jessie H Brown

_1 Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go, 
Anywhere He leads me in this world below; 
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade; 
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

_CHORUS
Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

_2 Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own; 
Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways, 
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

_3 Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep, 
When the darkening shadows round about me creep, 
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam; 
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.

### 7. A SHELTER IN THE TIME OF STORM 
#### Author: Vernon J.

_1 The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide, 
A shelter in the time of storm; 
Secure whatever ill betide, 
A shelter in the time of storm. 

_CHORUS
Mighty Rock in a weary land, 
Cooling shade on the burning sand 
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band
A shelter in the time of storm.

_2 A shade by day, defense by night, 
A shelter in the time of storm 
No fears alarm, no foes afright, 
A shelter in the time of storm. 

_3 The raging storms may round us beat, 
A shelter in the time of storm 
We'll never leave our safe retreat, 
A shelter in the time of storm.

_4 O Rock divine, O Refuge dear, 
A Shelter in the time of storm; 
Be Thou our helper ever near, 
A Shelter in the time of storm.

### 8. AT THE DOOR

_1 The coming King is at the door, 
Who once the cross for sinners bore, 
But now the righteous ones alone, 
He comes to gather home.

_CHORUS
At the door, at the door, 
At the door, yes, even at the door, 
He is coming, He is coming, 
He is even at the door.

_2 The signs that show His coming near 
Are fast fulfilling year by year, 
And soon we'll hail the glorious dawn 
Of heaven's eternal morn.

_3 Look not on earth for strife to cease, 
Look not below for joy and peace, 
Until the Savior comes again, 
To banish death and sin.

_4 Then in the glorious earth made new, 
We'll dwell the countless ages through. 
This mortal shall immortal be, 
And time, eternity. 

### 9. BAPTIZE US A NEW
#### Author: W. A. Ogden
_1 Baptize us anew with power from on high, 
With love, O refresh us! Dear Savior, draw nigh.

_2 We humbly beseech Thee, Lord Jesus, we pray,
With love and the spirit baptize us today.

_3 Unworthy we cry, Unholy, unclean,
O wash us and cleanse us From sin's guilty stain

_4 O heavenly Dove, Descend from on high!
We plead Thy rich blessing, In mercy draw nigh.

_5 O list the glad voice! From heaven it came,
Thou art my beloved, Well pleased I am.

The glories of my God and King, 
Blessed be the name of the Lord!

_CHORUS
Blessed be the name, Blessed the name.
Blessed be the name of the Lord 
Blessed be the name, Blessed be the name, (&c_s)
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

_2 Jesus the name that charms our fears, 
Blessed be the name of the Lord. 
'Tis music in the sinner's ears, 
Blessed be the name of the Lord 

_3 He breaks the power of cancelled sin, 
Blessed be the name of the Lord. 
His blood can make the foulest clean, 
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

11 BEFORE JEHOVAH'S AWFUL THRONE Isaac Watts Before Jehovah's awful throne, Ye nations bow with sacred joy, Know that the Lord is God alone, He can create and He destroy.








His sovereign power without our aid, Made us of clay, and formed us men; And when like wandering sheep we strayed, He brought us to His fold again

We will crowd His gates with thankful songs, High as the heavens our voices raise; And earth with her ten thousand tongues, Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.

Wide as the world is His command, Vast as Eternity His love; Firm as a rock His truth shall stand, When rolling years shall cease to move.

12 BLESSED ASSURANCE,M JESUS IS MINE Fanny J. Crosby Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! O what a fore taste of glory divine! Heir of salvation, purchase of God, Born of his spirit,

Washed in' His blood.

This is my story this my song, Praising my

Savior all the day long, This is my story this is my song, Praising my Savior, all the day long

Perfect submission, perfect delight, Visions of rapture

Now burst on my sight, Angels descending, bring from above,

Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest, I in my Savior am happy and blest, Watching and waiting, looking above, Filled with his goodness

Lost in his love.

13 BEAUTIFUL ROBES

We shall walk with him in white. In that country pure and bright, Where shall enter naught that may defile, Where the day beam ne'er declines, For the blessed light that shines, is the glory of the Savior's smile.

Beautiful robes, beautiful robes, Beautiful robes, We then shall wear, Garments of light, Lovely and bright, Walking with Jesus in white, Beautiful robes, we shall wear.

We shall walk with him in white, Where faith yields to blissful sight, When the beauty of the king we see; Holding converse full and sweet, In a fellowship complete; Waking songs of holy melody

and sweet,In a fellowship complete; Waking songs of holy melody.

We shall walk with Him in white,By the fountains of delight, Where the Lamb His ransomed ones shall lead,For His blood shall wash each stain, Till no spot of sin remain,And the soul forevermore is freed 14 SIDE BY SIDE

Side by side we stand awaiting God's command, Worshiping the saving King.Living by His grace and moving on in faith; Jesus Himself will see us through.

Meet me in heaven, we'll join hands together;Meet me by the Savior's side. I'll meet you in heaven, we'll sing songs together; Brothers and sisters, I'll be there!

Soldiers all are we to go where Jesus leads, We'll fight in faith and we will overcome.Heaven is our goal, and saving every soul;Pray that we all will be there. Praise the Lord we all will be there!

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO

15 P.P Bliss Hear the words our Savior hath spoken, Words of life, unfailing and true; Careless one, prayerless one, hear and remember, Jesus says, "Blessed are they that do."

Blessed are they that do His commandments, Blessed are they, blessed are they; Blessed are they that do His commandments, Blessed, blessed, blessed are they.

All in vain we hear His commandments, All in vain His promises, too; Hearing them, fearing them, never can save us, Blessed, O

blessed, are they that do. They with joy may enter the city, Free from sin, from sorrow and strife, Sanctified, glorified, now and forever, They may have right to

the tree of life.

16 BLESSED QUIETNESS

Joys are flowing like a river, since the Comforter has come; He abides with us forever, makes the trusting heart His home. Blessed

quietness, holy quietness, Sweet assurance in my soul!

MP. Ferguson


On the stormy sea Jesus speaks peace to me, And the billows cease to roll!

Bringing life and health and gladness, all around this heavenly Guest, banished unbelief and sadness, changed our weariness to rest Like the rain that falls from heaven, like the sunlight from the sky, so the Comforter is given, coming on us from on high.

Lo!Afruitful field is growing;blessed fruit of righteousness; And the stream of life are flowing, in the lonely wilderness What a wonderful salvation, Where we always see his face;

What a peaceful habitation, What a quiet resting place. 17 BREAK THOU THE BREAD OF LIFE Mary A. Lathbur

Break thou the bread of life, dear Lord, to me, as thou didst break the loaves beside the sea; beyond the sacred page I seek thee, Lord;my spirit pants for thee, O Living Word!

Bless thou the truth, dear Lord, to me, to me, as thou didst bless the bread by Galilee; then shall all bondage cease, all fetters fall; and i shall find my peace, my all in all.

Spirit and life are they, Words Thou dost speak; I hasten to obey, But I am weak; Thou art my only help, Thou art my life; Heeding Thy holy Word I win the strife. "ob trick yar

WE'LL BUILD ON THE ROCK

18 F.E.Belden 1. We'll build on the Rock, the living Rock, OnJesus,the Rock of Ages; So shall we abide the fearful shock, When loud the tempest rages.

We'll build on the Rock, We'll build on the Rock; We'll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock, On Christ, the mighty Rock. 20

Some build on the sinking sands of life, On visions of earthly treasure; Some build on the waves of sin and strife, Of fame, and worldly pleasure.

O build on the Rock, for ever sure, The firm and the true foundation Its hope is the hope which shall endure, The hope of our salvation.

BRING THEM IN

Hark! 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear, Out in the desert dark and drear, Calling the sheep who've gone astray, Far from the Shepherd's fold away. Bring them in, Bring them in, Bring them in from the fields of

W. A Ogden

sin;Bring them in, Bring them in, Bring the wanderers to Jesus. Who'll go and help the Shepherd kind, Help Him the wandering ones to find? Who'll bring them back into the fold, Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?

Out in the desert hear their cry, Out on the mountain wild and high, Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee," Go, find My sheep where 'er they be."

20 CALLED TO THE FEAST

E.S.Lorenz

Called to the feast by the King are we, Sitting, perhaps, where His people he; How will it fare, friend, with thee and me When the King comes in?

When the King comes in, brother, When the King; comes in! How will it fare with thee and me When the King comes in? Crowns on the head where the thorns have been, Glorified He who

once died for men; Splendid the vision before us then, When the King comes in. Like lightning's flash will that instant show Things hidden long from

both friend and foe; Just what we are will each neighbor know,

When the King comes in. Joyful His eyes shall on each one rest, who is in white wedding garments dressed; ah well for us if we stand the test, when the king

comes

20-a. JOY TO THE WORLD

Joy to the world, the Lord is come! Let earth receive her King; Let every heart prepare Him room, And heaven and nature sing, And heaven and nature sing, And heaven, And heaven and nature sing. Joy to the earth, the Saviour reigns! Let men their songs employ; While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains, Repeat the sounding joy, Repeat the sounding joy, Repeat; repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sin and sorrow grow, Nor thorns infest the ground; He comes to make his blessing flow, Far as the curse is found, Far as t curse is found, Far as, far as the curse is found

He rules the world with truth and grace, And makes the nation prove The glories of his righteousness, And wonders of his love, And wonders of his love, And wonders, and wonders of his love.

21 SOFTLY AND TENDERLY Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling for you and for me; see, on the portals he's waiting and watching, watching for you and for W.L. Thompson

me.

Come home, come home; ye who are weary come home; earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, calling, O sinner, come home! Why should we tary when Jesus is pleading, pleading for you and for me? Why should we linger and heed not his mercies, mercies for you and for me?

22 CHIEF OF SINNERS

Chief of sinners though I be, Jesus shed His blood for me; Died that I might live on high, Died that I might never die; As the brance is to the vine, I am His, and He is mine.

O the height of Jesus' love! Higher than the heaven above, Deeper than the deepest sea, Lasting as eternity; Love that found me wondrous thought! Found me when I sought Him not! Chief of sinners though I be, Christ is all in all to me; All my wants to Him are known, All my sorrows are His own; Safe with Him from earthly strife, He sustains the hidden life.

IT MAY BE AT MORN It may be at morn, when the day is awaking, When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking, That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory To receive from the world His own.

It may be at midday, it may be at twilight, It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory, When Jesus receives His own.

O joy! O delight! should we go without dying, No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying, Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory, When Jesus receives His own. 24-JUST WHEN I NEED HIM MOST

William Poole

Just when I need Him, Jesus is near, Just when I falter, just when I fear; Ready to help me, ready to cheer, Just when I need Him most. Just when I need Him most, Just when I need Him most,

Jesus is near to comfort and cheer, Just when I need Him most. Just when I need Him, Jesus is true, Never forsaking all the way through; Giving for burdens pleasures anew, Just when I need Him

most. Just when I need Him, Jesus is strong, Bearing my burdens all the day long; For all my sorrow giving a song, Just when I need Him

most. Just when I need Him, He is my all. Answering when upon Him I call; Tenderly watching lest I should fall, Just when I need Him

most. 25 CLOSER TO THEE, MY FATHER, DRAW ME

Closer to Thee, my Father, draw me, I long for Thine embrace; Closer within Thine arms enfold me, I seek a resting place.

Closer with the cords of love, Draw me to Thyself above;

Closer draw me, To Thyself above. Closer to Thee, my Saviour, draw me Nor let me leave Thee more; Fain would I feel Thine arms around me, And count my wanderings o'er.

Closer by Thy sweet Spirit draw me Till I am all like Thee; Quicken, refine, and wash, and cleanse me, Till I am pure and free. 26 COUNT YOUR MERCIES

Are you heavy laden and with sorrow tried? Look to faith to Christ, your Helper, Friend, and Guide; Think of all your mercies, such a boundless store, Tears will change to praises as you count them o'er. 13
